			<h1>Dungeon Master Rules</h1>
			<p>
				These are some of the rules I use to govern how I make decisions for this campaign. The purpose of putting these rules on this site is mainly to assist in my own memory. However I feel it is important to solidify many of the decisions I make with regards to different aspects of running the campaign.
