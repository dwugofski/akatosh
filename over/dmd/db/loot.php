<h2><a class="anchor" id="loot"></a>Loot</h2>
			<p>
				No grand adventure is complete without the sweet rewards for defeating the toughest foes. This section outlines the method by which I devise the rewards the players receive during the campaign. There are three main sources of loot: <em>encounters</em>, <em>treasure</em>, and <em>quests</em>. While there are many differences in loot calculation both between and within the sources of loot, so a detailed review of section must be provided. It should go without saying these rules are general rules of thumb. When I feel a situation requires a special touch for one reason or another, I usually modify my approach. Do not be surprised to see these rules broken frequently.
			</p>

			<h3>Encounter Loot</h3>
			<p>
				Encounter loot is discovered when the party defeats a group of enemies and searches the corpses for loot. Any weapons on the bodies are accessible to the players. Typically, however, enemies will not contain any special items, apart from special enemies from whom <a href="index.php?section=mag">magical items</a> may be recovered. The main loot of encounters is gold.
				</p><p>
				The amount of gold recovered from an encounter is a function of the CR of the hardest enemy, the number of enemies, and the tier of the encounter. The CR of the hardest enemy in the encounter determines the type of dice to use, according to table 1.1 below. After this amount of gold is calculated, multply the loot by a number based on the number of other enemy creatures in the encounter, outlined in table 1.2 below. Alternatively, if the encounter is small (approx. fewer than 5 enemies), roll for loot on each creature, using their CR&rsquo;s dice.

			<h3>Treasure Loot</h3>
			<p>
				Treasure loot is recovered from containers dispersed throughout dungones. There are three main sizes of containers, each with their own class of loot to draw from: <em>small</em>, <em>medium</em>, and <em>large</em> containers. In addition to some special items provided by the different containers, each container has the chance to provide a certain amount of gold. The specifics of gold rolling for trasure containers is laid out further in this section. 
			</p>
			<h4>Small Containers</h4>
			<p>
				Small containers (jars, urns, barrels, etc.) contain <span class="loot">small loot</span>, which is mostly a small amount of gold. When generating loot for a small container, roll for gold and roll a d10. If the result is 10 roll for a minor magical item, as described in table 1.3.
			</p>
			<h4>Medium Containers</h4>
			<p>
				Medium containers (chests, trunks, lockers, etc.) contain <span class="loot">medium loot</span>, which is a decent amount of gold and a few other items. When generating loot for a medium container, roll for gold and a minor magical item (see table 1.3). Then roll a d10. If the result is 10, include a treasure whose value is determined by a d100 + 50.
				</p><p>
				If the medium container is secret, locked, or trapped roll for a major magical item (see table 1.4) instead of a minor magical item. Additionally, include a treasure if the roll is 5 or higher. For compunded difficulty (e.g. secret and locked), add 1 minor magical item for each additional level of difficulty.
			</p>
			<h4>Large Containers</h4>
			<p>
				Large containers (essentially big chests) contain <span class="loot">large loot</span>, which is a large amount of gold and several special items. When generating loot for a large container, roll for gold, two minor magical items (see table 1.4), and a treasure whose value is determined by a d100 + 50. Then roll a d10. If the result is 10, include a major magical item as well.
				</p><p>
				If the large container is secret, locked, or trapped, roll for an additional major magical item (see table 1.4). Additionally, if the auxhilary roll is a success, include two major magical items instead of just one. For compounded difficulty (e.g. secret and locked), add 2 minor magical items for each additional level of difficulty.
			</p>
			<h4>Boss Containers</h4>
			<p>
				Boss containers are treated as large containers that are locked, trapped, and secret, with a successful bonus role, despite being none of those. They have large container gold, d100 + 50 treasure item, two minor magical items, and six major magical items.
			</p>
			<h4>Rolling for Gold</h4>
			<p>
				Each type of container has a gold dice associated with it plus a modifier equal to have the max roll. Small containers have a 1d4 + 2. Medium containers have a 1d20 + 10. Large containers have a 1d100 + 50. If the container is secret, increase the number of gold dice rolled by 1. Do the same for locked or trapped containers (for a total of 4 gold dice rolled for a secreted, locked, trapped container, plus one constant modifier).
			</p>
			<h4>Rolling for Magical Items</h4>
			<p>
				Some chests contain magical items. To determine what item is contained in a chest, roll a d20 and add loot based on the following tables (note that arrows can be replaced by bolts if relevant):

			<h3>Leveling Loot</h3>
			<p>
				As the characters advance, the gear provided to them increases in quality. In general, multiply any gold received by the tier of the party. For leveling details on recovered equipment, refer to the <a href="index.php?section=mech#equipment">equipment</a> section of the mechanics page. For recovered magical items, refer to the <a href="index.php?section=mech#magicka">magical items</a> section. For potion levels, refer to the <a href="index.php?section=mag#potions">potions</a> section of the magical items page.
			</p>

			<h3>Traps and Locks</h3>
			<p>
				Trap and lock DCs are determined by a 1d10 + mod roll. The constant modifier is determined by the difficulty of the lock. A 0 suggests a very easy mechanism. A 5 corresponds to a standard mechanism. 10 is comparable to a moderately difficult mechanism. A 15 is used for the toughest of mechanisms.
				</p><p>
				For traps, the damage of the trap is determined by a d8 roll according to table 1.5. For especially dangerous traps, increase the number of rolls as desired. The method of the damage should be decided by situation, but spike traps, poison gas traps, poison dart traps, and fire/ice/shock traps are fairly standard.
