			<h1>Gameplay Basics</h1>
			<p>
				This campaign is played using <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</em> rules. Overall, we have tried to stay consistent with those rules. However some adjustments were made to accomodate the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> setting, suit player prefferences, and fit the DM&rsquo;s (my) preferred practices. This section provides an outline of the major changes made for the campaign for leveling, services, and equipment.
