<h2><a class="anchor" id="leveling"></a>Leveling</h2>
			<p>
				Leveling in D&amp;D 5e is based on a &lsdquo;quadratic-in-cumulative&rsdquo; curve. Meaning, if you were to draw out the experience required to reach a certain level, it would appear roughly quadratic. However the game creators did create some variance in how leveling works within each tier. In the first tier, leveling is fairly easy until you try to get to levels four and five; then it is very difficult. Once you get to level five, you enter a new tier, and advancements is basically steady, with the amount of XP needed to advance increasing linearly (quadratic-in-cumulative behavior). Then you reach level eleven and the difficulty to reach the next level goes down a bit. Then it continues to increase linearly.
				</p><p>
				Personally, I have two issues with this pattern. First, I do not like dealing with hundreds and thousands of points. In my experience, people tend to just go &plusmn;50%, so if you&rsquo;re dealing in the thousands, you just go &plusmn;500. In the tens you go &plusmn;5, etc. So it made more sense to me to just deal in normalized &ldquo;XP Units&rdquo; rather than figuring out how to deal out hundreds of points.
				</p><p>
				I also prefer this route because I reward XP on a quest-basis, encapsulating all the difficulty of however many enemies the players had to kill into the difficulty of the quest, along with any challenges or tasks the party had to deal with. I do this because I prefer the reward for the quest (XP) not require players to kill things. If the players figure out some clever way of avoiding a pit full of monsters and still complete their task, I want to reward them, not punish them. And when you give XP from quests rather than monsters, it makes more sense to group the XP into normalized units rather than hundreds of points.

			<h3>XP &amp; Leveling System</h3>
			<p>
				Below is a table listing the amount of points required to level up, as well as how many points need be accumulated since the last leveling to level again. It is in essence a neater point system than that used by the official 5e PHB, but follows the same basic layout. It starts out very easy to reach level 3. Transitioning from three to four and four to five is difficult. For the second tier it is quadratic-in-cumulative, with a very simple transition from five to six, but a hard trasition around ten. After that for the final two tiers it is again quadratic-in-cumulative: easy to transition from eleven to twelve, but very hard from ninteen to twenty.

			<h3>Awarding Points</h3>
			<p>
				When I created this system, I figured I would reward one XP unit per quest, but I realized that was too generous. As well, it did not give me much flexibility to reward more XP for harder quests. So I ended up handing out rewards in units of eighths. So it may actually be much more practical to multiply these numbers by eight (possibly even ten) so you do not have to deal with fractions. By the time I had formalized this system, I had already started giving them fractional points, so I will stick with that. The general reward scheme is one-eighth XP for stupidly simple quests (fetch, bounties, etc.), one-fourth XP for quick-and-easy but still meaningful quests, one-half for important and somewhat challenging quests, one for difficult quests.
