		<h2><a class="anchor" id="haggling"></a>Haggling</h2>
			<p>
				In some circumstances a player may wish to haggle on the price of goods. To facilitate this, salespersons will have a haggling DC. The standard "indiffient" haggling DC is 15. Certain factors, such as trying to haggle with an antagonistic/friendly salesperson, will affect this DC. Haggling relationships can also affect the base price a merchant is willing to buy/sell a good for. It is up to the DM to determine how affected a merchant&rsquo;s haggling DC and base price is affected by relationship. However a general rule of thumb is laid out in the following table. These rules of tumb are pulled from the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy/">Pathfinder diplomacy system</a>.

				Additonal factors such as especially high Charisma or Intelligence may add aditional modifiers at the DM&rsquo;s discretion. When dealing with fences, the standard "indifferent" DC is increased to 17, as the fences know the party has very limited options in whom to sell to. Prices for fences are increased/decreased (depending on which hurts the character) by a factor of 10%. The price provided for items noted with the "(fenced)" attribute are provided without this 10% price reduction (so an addition 10% is still applied when the character tries to sell to a fence).
				</p><p>
				When haggling, roll a CHA (Persuasion) check. If the character succeeds the check, for each point above the haggling DC (miniumum 1), complete the transaction with a 10% gain/loss on the price of the good (depending on whichever benefits the player). If the character fails the check, increase the DC by 1. This haggling DC modification applies to all party members the merchant associates with the character. Should the DC modifier cross the thresholds listed above, base price modification will be incurred.
