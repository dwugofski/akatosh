<h2><a class="anchor" id="magicka"></a>Working with Magicka</h2>
			<p>
				Unlike in the D&amp;D 5e universe, the world of Tamriel is inundated with magic. As such, the rules regarding magic had to be adjusted to make it more prevalent. This section provides an overview of the three main areas in which the characters will interact with magicka: enchanted items, scrolls, and learning spells. To see a list of magical items that I have added to the campaign, please refer to the <a href="../over/index.php?section=mag">Magical Items</a> page.
			</p>
			<h3><a class="anchor" id="enchanted_items"></a>Enchanted Items</h3>
			<p>
				Most enchanted items in the campaign will have a limited number of uses. As they are used, the magicka powering them will become drained, requiring them to be recharged. In order to recharge these uses, the party will have a few options. They can use <a href="../over/index.php?section=mag#varla_stone">Varla Stones</a> to completely restore the magicka in the object. They can use filled <a href="../over/index.php?section=mag#soul_gem">Soul Gems</a> to replenish the object. Or they can go to an enchanter who will replenish the uses of the object. Passive enchantments will not use magicka and thus will not need to be restored.
				</p><p>
				The amount of uses a soul gem restores as well as the cost to restore uses an enchanter will charge will vary depending on the enchanting level of the object: petty, lesser, common, greater, and grand enchantments. To see how much it will take to recharge an item, consult the following table:

			<h4>Enchanting and Disenchanting Items</h4>
			<p>
				City enchtanters are also capable of enchanting items. Typically, they will only enchant items in simple ways, but occasionally they may be willing to place custom enchantments on items if the characters perform some task for them. The strength of an enchantment is represented in its level. For each enchantment, the number of uses is determined during creation with a base number of uses plus a dice roll. The custom enchantments vary with each enchanter, but every enchanter offers the same standard set of simple enchantments, listed below.

			<p>
				The maximum enchantment level which can be placed on an item is determined by the equipment&rsquo;s tier. Starter gear &mdash; tier zero &mdash; can only have petty enchantments placed on it. Tier one can have lesser enchantments. Tier two allows for common enchantments. Tier three gear can hold greater enchantments, and lastly tier four gear can bear up to grand enchantments. Once an item has been enchanted, it cannot be enchanted again.
				</p><p>
				Special enchanted items are typically gained as rewards for completing quests. Each enchanted item encountered in this way can be disenchanted to learn the spell behind it. While wizards are the only class capable of learning any spells through these means, exceptions may be made for other classes provided the spell is something related to their class. Disenchanting the item destroys it, and enchanted items with no uses cannot be disenchanted.
				</p><p>
				Player characters may enchant items themselves, but it will require the character to use a soul gem filled with a soul of the same level as the enchantment. They may then enchant the item with a spell they know, though the ultimate effect of such an enchantment will be determined by the DM. Alternately, if they allow an enchanter to use a filled soul gem, the enchanter will be willing to enchant an item with an enchantment of the same level as the filled soul for 10 gp. Or they will place an enchantment of lesser level for free. 
			</p>
			<h4>Enchanting Ammunition</h4>
			<p>
				Any enchanted ranged weapon with ammunition will take one use to charge its basic ammunition with the enchantment effect before firing. If the ammunition is itself enchanted, the enchantments will not stack and the ammunition enchantment effect will take precedence. Firing the enchanted ranged weapon in this case will not consume a use. When enchanting ammunition, the amount of amunition enchanted is equal to the number of uses rolled. You do not need to purchase base ammunition to enchant. 
			</p>
			<h4>Soul Trapping</h4>
			<p>
				In order to fill a soul gem, a character with a soul gem must cast Soul Trap on a creature and kill that creature before the spell wears off. Even then, if the character does not have a soul gem of level greater than the soul of the deceased, no souls gems will be filled. Soul Trap is a sorceror/warlock/wizard cantrip, though wizards with the Necromancy Arcane Tradition gain the cantrip automatically.
				</p><p>
				The level of a soul is determined by its challenge rating. Each level represents a tier (with &ldquo;petty&rdquo; and &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; both representing the first and second halves of the first tier respectively). If a creature would be considered a &ldquo;hard&rdquo; encounter for a single character in a given tier, that creature possesses a soul of the level corresponding to that tier. The only exception to this rule are &ldquo;black&rdquo; &mdash; NPC &mdash; souls, which can only fill black soul gems. Conversely, black soul gems can only be filled by black souls. Black souls have a soul level corresponding to grand souls, regardless of challenge rating.
				</p><p>
				The table below shows a detailed breakdown of the costs of soul gems and the challenge ratings corresponding to each soul level:

			<h4>Making Black Soul Gems</h4>
			<p>
				While other empty soul gems may only be purchased, black soul gems may be created from grand soul gems. This process is known only by necromancers. A wizard with the Necromancy Arcane Tradition will learn the ritual for creating black soul gems at 6th level. The ritual can only be performed once a day, at night, over the course of several hours in seclusion. The ritual will transform one grand soul gem into a black soul gem.
			</p>

			<h3>Learning Magic</h3>
			<p>
				The court wizards and sagacious mages throughout Tamriel are too busy with their own studies to be offering lessons to any old adventurer who wanders in off the street. If players wish to learn from those mages, they will have to provide some assitance. Typically this will involve getting their hands dirty doing whatever laborious task the mages do not want to or cannot do themselves.
				</p><p>
				Once a mage is willing to teach the party a spell, he or she will offer to educate them in an assortment of spells. The assortment will contain spells from level one spells to level five spells. For the most part these spells will belong to the wizard class. Exceptions can be made if a wizard is pursuing a niche subject and there are no good wizard spells for that area.
				</p><p>
				Only a wizard can learn spells in this manner. Additionally, if a mage chooses to charge the party member for the education, it will amount to <span class="mono bred">500 &times; caster level</span> in gp. It will also take one day per caster level of research. Wizards can only learn spells if they have spell slots available for those levels.
			</p>
			<h4>Sharing Spells</h4>
			<p>
				Wizards can learn spells from any other spellcasters. However the process of learning the spell requires 2 hours and 50 gp per spell level. Wizards cannot teach and learn simultaneously, but multiple wizards can learn from the same teacher. The number of hours per spell level is increased by a factor of 1.5 (rounded up) for each additional person (3 hr/lv for 2 learners, 5 hrs/lv for 3, 7 hrs/lv for 4, etc...). If the time to learn would be cut in half, do not count them in this calculation. If all students are savants (and there are more than one), it takes 2 hrs/lv. Gold cost is as normal for each person and additive (e.g. 2 wizards pay a total of 100 gp/lv).
				</p><p>
				The gold cost is the expensive of getting materials for practicing and recording the spells. As such, it is necessary to be in or around a town or other place spellcasting equipment can be purchased. Additonally, learning spells required a properly-equipped lab. Additonal costs can be incurred from court wizards or other mages to rent out their labs for experimenting. Typical going rates are 10 gp/hr (this cost is unaffected by the savant feature, though of course the time will be).
			</p>

			<h3>Scrolls</h3>
			<p>
				Some mages will sell scrolls to make a living or to supplement their income. Every mage who offers this service has their own list of spells they offer to make scrolls of. The cost of a scroll is <span class="mono bred">200 &times; caster level</span> in gp. Any character may use a scroll, provided they are of a certain level. The level requirements to cast spells are shown below:
