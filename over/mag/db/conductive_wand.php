			<p class="uind">
				The Conductive Wand is a mysterious Daedric artifact. It is a long wooden stick tipped with copper. The shape and weight of the wand is consistent with that used by a conductor, but it gives off magical energies which suggest a mystical potential to it.
				</p><p>
				Offensively, it can be used to shoot a bolt of electricity towards a target. The caster makes a ranged touch attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes <span class="die dmg lightning">1d4</span> lightning damage. 
				</p><p>
				Defensively, without the wielder having to make any actions, any incomming ranged attacks made against a creature wielding this wand may get hit by bolts of lightning. Incoming damage is reduced by <span class="die dmg">1d4</span>. Additionally, if a creature hits the wielder of this wand with a melee attack, the creature must make a <span class="die save con">CON</span> saving throw (with DC equal to the highest spellcaster DC, or 10 if the wielder is not a spellcaster) or be struck by electricity and paralyzed until the start of the weilder&rsquo;s next turn. 
				</p><p>
				This device has a capacity for 16 uses. However the passive/defensive uses of the wand do not count towards the item&rsquo;s charges.
