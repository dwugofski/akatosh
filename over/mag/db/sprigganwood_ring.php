						The Sprigganwood Ring can be used to bestow the <em>Ensnaring Strike</em> enchantment on a wooden projectile, with a DC equal to the highest spell save DC of the enchanter, or 10 in the event the creature is not a spellcaster. When a projectile with the Ensnaring Strike enchantment hits its target, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a <span class="die save str">STR</span> saving throw or be restrained by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.
						</p><p>
						While restrained by the spell, the target takes <span class="die dmg pierce">1d6</span> piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a <span class="die str">STR</span> check against the spell&rsquo;s DC. On a success, the target is freed.
						</p><p>
						The damage per turn is increased by <span class="die dmg pierce">1d6</span> per enchantment level. This item can be used to enchant up to 6 projectiles a day for up to 21 uses. Rangers and druids will be able to enchant up to 6 more projectiles a day.
