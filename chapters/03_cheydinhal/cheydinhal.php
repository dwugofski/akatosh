				<h1><a id="city_of_cheydinhal_anc" class="anchor"></a>The City of Cheydinhal</h1>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					Originally a small fort defending the eastern pass through the Velothi Mountains, Cheydinhal quickly became an economic hub for commerce between Cyrodiil and Morrowind. For a long time, the city has been effectively controlled by merchant lords who rule over Nibenese commerce. For many years, the city was under the grip of these merchant lords. Recently, <span class="npc"><a href="#Countess">Countess Finna</a></span> and her husband have restored a greater degree of order and equality to the city. Still, the city is fundamentally guided by a mercenary pursuit of profit.
				</p>
				<h2><a id="cheydinhal_overview_anc" class="anchor"></a>City Overview</h2>
				<p>
					The city of Cheydinhal is divided east/west into two parts by a creek running through crossed by two bridges. On the western side of the city you have <span class="loc"><a href="#castle_cheydinhal_anc">Castle Cheydinhal</a></span> atop a hill. To the south of the castle, and along the creek you have the <span class="loc"><a href="#market_anc">market district</a></span>, where various shops and city-serving markets are located. On the eastern side of the city is the <span class="loc"><a href="#temple_anc">Temple of the One</a></span>, as well as the housing district and <span class="loc"><a href="#nobles_anc">nobles&rsquo; district</a></span>.
					</p><p>
					The architecture in the city resembles that of most Nibenese cities: light painted stucco buildings with exposed wooden frames of dark timber. The rooftops are shingled with exaggerated slants.
					</p><p>
					Cheydinhal is divided into two major social classes: the working class and the merchant elite. The working class provides the main services of the city. They run the shops, build the structures, farm, etc. The merchant elite do not contribute labor to the city, but benefit the economy by purchasing goods, paying taxes, and motivating development. The merchant elite vie with each other to control influence in the city. Long ago the competition evolved from a desire to manipulate tariffs in their favor, but now, among the elite, political influence is a status symbol. Invitations to state balls or private events from members of the court are displayed as trophies in the homes of the elite.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="castle_cheydinhal_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 1: Castle Cheydinhal</h3>
				<p>
					A former fort built for defensive reasons against possible attacks from Morrowind, Castle Cheydinhal is heavily fortified and armed. It is located at the top of a hill, providing a clear view of the Velothi Mountains and the Nibenay Basin. Aside from the throne room where <span class="npc"><a href="#Countess">Countess Sattoria Finna</a></span> holds court, the castle contains a library, adjacent to a wizard&rsquo;s lab, and a dungeon containing two residents: Shaari-La (a male Khajiit convicted of prostitution) and <span class="npc"><a href="#Albrecht">Albrecht Bombidius</a></span>.
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li class="heading">Court:</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="Countess" class="anchor"></a>Countess Sattoria Finna</span> (f. Imperial) is the countess of Cheydinhal. She obtained her position through shrewd manipulation of the markets of Cheydinhal. Her power comes from the numerous merchant guilds which operate in the city. She thinks very much as a merchant, pursuing the actions which produce the highest profit for the city.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="Steward" class="anchor"></a>Steward Invine Finna</span> (m. Imperial) is the husband of the countess and steward of the court. While the countess is cold and calculating, he typically provides the human touch necessary to keep the people of the city from revolting. He has his ear to the people, though whispers in his wife&rsquo;s ear to make her seem more compassionate.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="Wizard" class="anchor"></a>Daryn Hevuleth</span> (m. Dunmer) is the Court Wizard of Cheydinhal. He is a toady to the countess, and typically uses his talents to enhance her negotiating techniques. He is the questgiver for the <span class="quest">A Vile Deal</span> quest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="Albrecht" class="anchor"></a>Albrecht Bombidius</span> (m. Imperial) is a prisoner convicted of the crime of making deals with Daedric Princes. More details about him are discussed in the <span class="quest"><a href="#daedric_princes_anc">Daedric Princes and Where to Find Them</a></span> quest.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a id="temple_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 2: Temple of the One</h3>
				<p>
					Cheydinhal&rsquo;s temple resembles the same found throughout Cyrodiil. The real difference lies in what goes on inside. Not trusting the publicity of the city's inns or taverns, the merchant elite of Cheydinhall most often do their dealings in the catecombs beneath the temple. The temple's head priest <span class="npc"><a id="priest" class="anchor"></a>Julino Nithis</span> is the greatest asset to the countess. She used his information on the merchant lord dealings to outmaneuver them and establish herself as the prime successor to the throne.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="market_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 3: Market District</h3>
				<p>
					The market district south of the castle contains the major shops and services for the party.
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li class="heading">Merchants:</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="enchanter" class="anchor"></a>Enchanter: Rakul-ko</span> (m. Khajiit) is the main enchanter of Cheydinhal. He has Rings of Apparel, which allow the wearer to reform clothes into any desired form. Rakul-ko is the questgiver for the <span class="quest">Party Favors</span> quest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="smith" class="anchor"></a>Smith: Servol</span> (m. Nord) is one of the main smiths of Cheydinhal. Servol has a slight inferiority conplex. He believes he steel is superior to the Imperials' and Dunmer's, but he is not as good at wooing the merchant lords. In fact, most other merchants are too busy carrying out their orders to help the party. Servol is the questgiver for the <span class="quest">Hammering the Competition</span> quest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="karag" class="anchor"></a>Clothier: Karag Gro-Elimack</span> (m. Orc) Imformation on Karag is provided as part of the <span class="quest">Investigating Kemen</span> quest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a id="alchemist" class="anchor"></a>Alchemist: Jaermaie Dwaine</span> (m. Breton) Is a decripid, grumpy old Breton who does not have much patience for idleness or fools. Nontheless, he is widely regarded as a fine alchemist, and he dominates the Cheydinhal alchemy market, despite many people finding him to be shifty and hard to trust.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a id="inn_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 4: Inns</h3>
				<p>
					There are two main inns in Cheydinhal: The Silver Coin and The Sapped Senche. Both offer rooms for 10 gp a night per person, some basic food (bread, cheese, and stew) for 5gp, a bottle of wine or brandy for 5gp, and a mug of ale for 2gp. 
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li class="heading">The Silver Coin:</li>
					<li>
						The Silver Coin is an old, somewhat worn-down establishment. While obstensibly just an inn, many nearby Dunmer frequent it as a cornerclub. The decor and lighting are similar to that of a typical Nibenese inn. It seems the Dunmer just prefer going to a hole-in-the-wall where they don&rsquo;t expect to see any Imperials.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Proprieter: Rilyn Hlan</span> (m. Dunmer) is a recent immigrant to Cyrodil who was given ownership of the inn after the previous owner Saras Volos passed away. When Rilyn came to Cheydinhal, he had no prospects and soon was left begging in the streets. Saras took him in.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some Patrons (all Dunmer): Dravil Norvayne (m), Mulvisie Andalas (f), Salen Volos (m), Fendros Indaren (m), and Ane Veri (f).
					</li>
					<li class="heading">The Sapped Senche</li>
					<li>
						On the outside, the Sapped Senche appears similar to any other building in Cheydinhal, though slightly larger. However on the inside, the place is decorated with a pronounched Khajiiti flare. Functionally, though, it remains as a typical Cyrodiilic inn.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Proprietress: Izzariq</span> (f. Khajiit) is a former slave of house Dres, but paid for her freedom. She does not openly express any animosity towards Dunmer &mdash; putting on the same friendly, warm face she greets all customers with &mdash; but deep down does not trust Dunmer. 
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a id="inn_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 5: Taverns</h3>
				<p>
					There are three main taverns in Cheydinhal: The Ratty Racer, The Chilly Rend, and The Goblin&rsquo;s Bride. The first two offer some basic food (bread, cheese, and stew) for 5gp, a bottle of wine or brandy for 5gp, and a mug of ale for 2gp. The last one has higher quality versions of the previous, but prices are doubled.
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li class="heading">The Ratty Racer:</li>
					<li>
						The Ratty Racer is the official &ldquo;Cornerclub&rdquo; in Cheydinhal. However it has become quite popular among the non-Dunmer, so the Dunmer view it as inauthentic, preferring to go to The Silver Coin instead.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Barkeep: Menvel Fayen</span> (m. Dunmer) is a third-generation Dunmer in Cheydinhal. He is somewhat removed from Dunmer culture. He has pride in his heritage, but not having solid attachments to his culture have warped his view of it. Many of the more recent Dunmer migrants do not view Menval as being &ldquo;truly&rdquo; Dunmer.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some Patrons: Revon Surandys (m Dunmer), Maros Andalas (m Dunmer), Agne Verius (m Imperial), Gavros Angius (m Imperial), and Stilian Maratus (m Imperial).
					</li>
					<li class="heading">The Chilly Rend</li>
					<li>
						The Chilly Rend is the poor man&rsquo;s tavern. It&rsquo;s more run-down than any of the other main taverns, but its patrons are loyal, so it maintains a steady stream of income.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Barkeep: Tahm Blancio</span> (m. Breton) is the son of farmer. When his older brother got the family farm outside Cheydinhal, Tahm decided to pool his life savings to pay for the tavern. It was a rough start, but his family was friends with most Cheydinhal farmers, so they&rsquo;ve always had great patronage.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some Patrons (all m Imperial): Brochi Axius, Martio Rillian, Alevu Legus, Iluno Ospius, and Rave Maratus.
					</li>
					<li class="heading">The Goblin&rsquo;s Bride</li>
					<li>
						The Goblin&rsquo;s Bride is the high-class tavern, for up-and-coming merchants who are looking to live a life of luxury and comfort. It is located just south of the nobles district, and merchants love visiting it whenever they get a contract with one of the merchant lords.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Barkeep: Caecin Fentil</span> (m. Imperial) is a snobby, arrogant barkeep. He views himself &mdash; groundlessly &mdash; as the gatekeeper to the merchant lords. While the food and drink are of excellent quality, if it weren&rsquo;t for the prestige of his establishment, his poor service would have driven his patronage away.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some Patrons (all m Imperial): Zetronius Vunnis, Quitian Liuand, Leono Munfius, Farlowe Borad, and Lirrus Ovidus.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a id="nobles_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 6: Nobles District</h3>
				<p>
					Across the river from the castle, to the east of the temple, the rich families of Cheydinhal live in their elaborate estates. Each of the estates are guarded by a contingent of private guards, and a few dozen servants. Each of the trade companies is headed by one of the elite families, but most of the trades and deals are managed by lower-status citizens. The merchants lords simply oversee several merchants, providing resources to them and choosing which merchants to fund. The following are some basic names and descriptions of the merchants lords:
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li class="heading">Merchant Lords:</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Aton Senili</span> (m. Imperial) is the latest of three generations of massive wealth. His family still has the greatest influence in the city, but he has noticed the power slipping since he rose to lead the family. As a result, he is highly insecure in his ability to further the legacy of his fathers. Aton is relevant in the <span class="quest">Party Favors</span> quest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Jaena Kellic</span> (f. Breton) was once a close personal friend to Countess Sattoria. Ultimately Sattoria used their friendship to outmaneuver Kellic and leverage her family to force their support. Secretly Jaena resents Sattoria, and their friendship ended that day, but she knows she cannot openly oppose the Countess or risk their family losing influence. Jaena Kellic is relevant to the <span class="quest">Vile Deal</span> quest.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Tethis Hlallu</span> (m. Dunmer) is the representative of House Hlallu&rsquo;s interests in the region. Ultimately Tethis does not share the obsession with establishing showy political influence over the political officers of the city. Instead he focuses on maximizing profit for his house, and only feigns interest in ostentatious corruption in order to &ldquo;fit in&rdquo; with the other elite. Tethis is relevant to the <span class="quest">Hammering the Competition</span> quest.
					</li>
					<li class="heading">Other families:</li>
					<li class="doubleind">Kendri (Dunmer)</li>
					<li class="doubleind">Silver-Bloods (Nord)</li>
					<li class="doubleind">Varatus (Imperial)</li>
					<li class="doubleind">Anogli (Imperial)</li>
