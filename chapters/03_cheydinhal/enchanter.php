				<h2>Quest Overview</h2>
				<h5>XP: 1/4</h5>
				<p>
					The town&rsquo;s enchanter, Rakul-ko, wishes to sabotage the banquet of a merchant lord who insulted him. The party must go to the banquet and slip a concoction into the merchant lord&rsquo;s drink. Once the merchant lord drinks from the goblet, his apparel is transformed into humiliating garb.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="rakulko_anc" class="anchor"></a>Meeting the Enchanter</h3>
				<p>
					Several days ago, the merchant lord <span class="npc">Anton Selini</span> commissioned the city&rsquo;s premier enchanter: <span class="npc">Rakul-ko</span> to enchant a bathtub that could heat water to a desired temperature without burning the occupant. Rakul-ko spent many days layering enchantments into the tub, but by the time he finished, Anton had changed his mind and wanted a better-looking tub enchanted. Rakul-ko refused to enchant another tub before being paid for the first. Anton refused, accused Rakul-ko of being a no-good swindler and thief, &ldquo;Like all Khajiit.&rsquo; He then proceded to tarnish Rakul-ko&rsquo;s reputation among the merchant lords, and it has hurt Rakul-ko&rsquo;s business.
					</p><p>
					Rakul-ko wants to humiliate Anton. He is looking for someone who does not live in Cheydinhal, as he knows they would at best refuse to take risks with the merchant lords, and at worst betray him to Anton. If they party makes it known to Rakul-ko they are just passing through, he will request their aid. Additionally, after the party has gone around town for a while, their names will reach Rakul-ko&rsquo;s ears, and he will try sending a message to them. If they are staying at The Sapped Senche, the proprietress, Izzariq, will relay his message, as they know each other. 
					</p><p>
					If the party agrees to help him take his revenge, Rakul-ko will inform them he plans to strike during a banquet the merchant lord is hosting. For the past week, Anton has been celebrating his birthday, and each night there has been a lavish banquet in his honor. Rakul-ko wants the party to infiltrate a banquet and slip a concoction of his into Anton&rsquo;s drink. It isn&rsquo;t poison, but Rakul-ko wants the party to be surprised after slipping it into the drink.
					</p><p>
					Rakul-ko can provide the party with his trademark <span class="item">Rings of Apparel</span> so they can look like proper nobels. However he does not have any invitations to the banquet, so the party will have to figure out their own way in. He suggests hiring someone to forge the invitations, getting an invitation from one of the other merchant lords, or otherwise sneaking themselves into the banquet.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="infiltration_anc" class="anchor"></a>Infiltrating the Banquet</h3>
				<p>
					If the party wishes to buy a forged invitation, they can use some black market channels to get in touch with a forger, who will craft an invitation for 51 gp. Should the party be in good standing with any of the merchant lords or a member of the court, they will have access to an invitation through that channel. Should the party attempt to infiltrate the banquet without an invitation, they will have to break, sneak, or charm their way into the estate courtyard.
					</p><p>
					Fortunately, most of the security for the estate is centered around protecting the inner buildings. They outer wall is approximately 10 ft and is relatively porous, especially with so many of the guards monitoring the hallways for &ldquo;lost&rdquo; guests. The courtyard lies between two buildings: the main house and the servants&rsquo; quarters. The north and south walls border the courtyard, but only the south wall has a gate, at which two guards are stationed. Along the north wall there is a drainage grate, but it is hidden (DC 13) behind some rocks and bushes. 
					</p><p>
					The guards are normal human guards with 1d6 swords (+3 to hit), AC 10, and 20 HP. While it is difficult (DC 17) to persuade them to simply let them through, they will accept a bribe of 40 gp each if the party convinces them they won&rsquo;t make any trouble. 
				</p>

				<h2><a id="banquet_anc" class="anchor"></a>The Banquet</h2>
				<imagebox id="selini_map_box">

					<footnote>Figure 1.1: Banquet Layout</footnote>
				</imagebox>
				<p>
					The banquet is restricted to the courtyard of the Selini estate. Each of the red circles above indicates a cluster of partygoers. (1) indicates the central floor of the party. Here, there are tables for guests to place drinks as (Imperial, Breton, and Dunmer) servants scurry to and fro. (2) indicates the main service area, where much of the food is being laid out. It is a lavish meal, with several exotic fruits, vegetables, meats, and desserts. (3) indicates the location of the wine casks the servants pour drinks from. (4) is the location of the performing minstrels. A group of guests are dancing before the band. (5) marks a particularly shady area of the party; there are several trees and bushes in this corner of the courtyard. Lastly, Anton Selini, his wife, and his two brothers are seated at (6), flanked by two guards: one on either side.
					</p><p>
					Anton will not typically leave his seat. However he is not particularly suspicious, so attempts to get him to move will not be particularly difficult. If he does move for some reason, he will take his goblet with him, unless there is a reason for him to set it down. Because none of the guests know what the party members are up to, they will speak up if they are detected tampering &mdash; seemingly poisoning &mdash; Anton&rsquo;s wine. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="people_anc" class="anchor"></a>People</h3>
				<p>
					Here are the names and descriptions of several notable people at the party. Generally, conversation with these characters is meant to provide an insight into the life of Cheydinhal.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="heading">Hosts</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Anton Selini</span> (m. Imperial) is the main host. It is his birthday that is being celebrated. He is generally excited about the party and having a good time. However for him this party is a means of obscuring his insecurities that he&rsquo;s bringing about his family&rsquo;s descent from the most powerful merchant family in the city. He projects opulence, glut, and arrogance to overcompensate.
						</li><li>
						<span class="npc">Glenara Selini</span> (f. Breton) is the wife of Anton. She is generally frivolous, and does not think to much about things. She is sauced.
					</li>
					<li class="heading">Guests and Servants</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc">Dagmar Silver-Blood</span> (m. Nord) is the representative of the Silver-Blood family to the party. He is the second son of the Silver-Blood patriarch in the city, Anjur. He resents his family, and resents having to go to these banquets to keep up appearances for his family.
						</li><li>
						<span class="npc">Anillo Veratus</span> (m. Imperial) is there with his friend <span class="npc">Narriq</span> (m. Khajiit). Anillo is the patriarch of the Veratus family in Cheydinhal. The two spend all their time in the party talking with each other, often gossipping and making jokes at the expense of other guests.
						</li><li>
						<span class="npc">Freyn Kendri</span> (f. Dunmer) is the representative of the Kendri family. She is not enjoying the banquet quite as much as the other guests, and is standing near the wall around (5) not drinking her wine, but examining the plants and bushes. She&rsquo;s only here to examine the servants and see if she can poach one for her home after her previous Bosmer maid, Fenidrel, left.
						</li><li>
						<span class="npc">Scales-That-Glitter</span> (f. Argonian) is the majordomo. She gives instructions to the other servants to pour wine, bring out food, etc. She was the representative of the Selini house to Rakul-ko, and detested the demands Anton made of the enchanter. However she does not want to quit the house until she has something else lined up.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a id="ideas_anc" class="anchor"></a>Possible Scenarios</h3>
				<p>
					Here are several suggestions on how the party can dose Anton&rsquo;s drink. Presented are the ideas, the requirements for success, and the outcomes.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="heading">Get Anton to Dance</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Plan:</em> Get Anton and his wife to dance.</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Requirements:</em> A DC 14 CHA (Persuasion) check will allow a character to convince either Anton or his wife the two should dance. A DC 13 CHA (Persuasion) check or a bribe of 3 gp will convince the minstrels to invite Anton to dance, which he will accept.</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Outcomes:</em> A success will get Anton away from the table, bringing his wife and guards with him and leaving his goblet of wine unattended. A failure to persuade Anton or his wife will result in them explaining they've been partying for the past several days and wish to take a night off. A failure to persuade the minstrels will result in them explaining they don&rsquo;t think it would appropriate to impose on their employer.</li>

					<li class="heading">Poison the Bottle</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Plan:</em> Poison the bottle from which the severs pour Anton&rsquo;s wine</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Requirements:</em> Sneaking behind the wine table requires a DC 7 DEX (Stealth) check. Poisoning the bottle also requires a DC 15 DEX (Sleight-of-Hand) check.</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Outcomes:</em> If both checks are successful, a server will come to pour wine in Anton&rsquo;s goblet. If the stealth check fails, a server will request the character rejoin the party; if he or she wants wine, some will be brought to them. If the sleight-of-hand check fails, the wine bottle will be knocked over, and a server will make a similar remark.</li>

					<li class="heading">Drunken Brawl</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Plan:</em> Pick a fight with Dagmar Silver-Blood &mdash; a drunken Nord &mdash; to distract Anton</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Requirements:</em> Starting the fight with Dagmar requires a DC 7 CHA (Intimidation) check. Additionally, dosing the drink requires a DC 15 sleight-of-hand check</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Outcomes:</em> If a character fails to intimidate Dagmar, he will scoff and dismiss the character. The fight itself requires no skill, but will draw the attention of Anton and his guards. Anton will get up with his wife and guards, and set his drink next to the fighters while talking to them. If the sleight-of-hand check fails, the goblet will be knocked over.</li>

					<li class="heading">The Majordomo</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Plan:</em> Get Scales-That-Glitter to betray Anton and dose the wine by convincing Freyn Kendri to employ her.</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Requirements:</em> A DC 7 CHA (Persuasion) check will convince Freyn to hire Scales.</li>
					<li class="untabbed"><em>Outcomes:</em> Should the check fail, Freyn will say she needs to think it over before making a decision, but thanks them for their offer. After a successful persuasion check Freyn will tell the character to inform Scales to meet with her to discuss pay. After a private conversation for a bit, Scales will return to the party and thank them for their help, offering her help if they should need anything.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a id="end_anc" class="anchor"></a>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					If the party should successfully dose the wine, when Anton drinks from it, his clothes will transform. His formal Nibenese tunic and trousers will suddenly be replaced with that of a female Khajiit prostitute&rsquo;s. His wife&rsquo;s shriek will draw attention from the guests, who will laugh at the change in wardrobe. Humiliated, Anton will order his guards to kick the party-goers off estate grounds, and he will run back inside.
					</p><p>
					As a reward for their services, Rakul-ko will pay the party 25 gp per person, and he will let them each keep a <span class="item">Ring of Apparel</span>.
