				<h1><a id="vile_deal_anc" class="anchor"></a>A Vile Deal</h1>
				<h2>Quest Overview</h2>
				<h5>XP: 1/4</h5>
				<p>
					One of the merchant lords of Cheydinhal stole a valuable journal from the Countess. The court wizard, Daryn Hevuleth, has been tasked with retrieving it. He knows the book is being kept by Jaena Kellic, but her estate is well-guarded, and he needs the Thieves&rsquo; Guild to steal the book for him. Unfortunately the Thieves&rsquo; Guild has a deal with the Kellic family, and will not steal from her. The party must go in their stead.
					</p><p>
					The party works with the guild to plan a heist of the estate. During the night, they break into the estate, navigating hallways and various traps/alarms to access vault with the book.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="daryn_anc" class="anchor"></a>The Mage&rsquo;s Problems</h3>
				<p>
					Like most court wizards, Daryn spends most of his time in his lab/study. When the party meets him, he will of course be deep in his research, looking into ways to magically retrieve items from afar. He is desperate, and would be willing to &ldquo;let&rdquo; the party help him (and thus the Countess) recover a stolen item from a Merchant Lord. He will explain that he believes Jaena Kellic made off with a priceless book and that book needs to be recovered. He had hoped to use the Thieves&rsquo; Guild&rsquo;s help in this endeavor, but they do not seem to be responding to his attempts to contact them.
					</p><p>
					He strikes a deal with the party, offering the gold he would have paid the guild, some scrolls, or some lessons for any wizards.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="thieves_anc" class="anchor"></a>Contacting the Thieves&rsquo; Guild</h3>
				<p>
					The exact location of the Thieves&rsquo; Guild is not known by the average citizen. Farmers and other visitors from outside town certainly have no clue where they're located. Merchants with stores in the city are more likely to know, due to having to face extortion from the guild&rsquo;s thugs. The city guard knows the location of the guild, but are unlikely to help, unless they're corrupt and can be bribed. If the party waits, several hours after they meet with Daryn, an agent of the guild will come to meet with them to discuss the heist, directing them to the guild.
					</p><p>
					The guild is located in a house on the eastern edge of the city. The house is abandoned, and various thugs loiter about its delapidated exterior. They will prevent the party from entering, but will let them through if they have met with Daryn, at the behest of one of their leaders, <span class="npc">Dusktone</span>.
					</p><p>
					Dusktone (a female Imperial) is one of the officers of the guild in Cheydinhal. She is keenly aware of the situation between Countess Finna and Lady Kellic. She informs the party Kellic and Finna used to be friends, but Finna betrayed the friendship to get to power. Now Kellic wants revenge, but she cannot openly challenge her. 
					</p><p>
					Dusktone informs the party the Thieves&rsquo; Guild is in an awkward position. They made deals with both Finna and Kellic not to steal from them. They cannot retrieve the book themselves. However they cannot abide thieves in the city they do not control, so the theft cannot go unpunished. Therefore the guild will be willing to help the party infiltrate the Kellic estate and steal back the book.
				</p>

				<h2><a id="plan_anc" class="anchor"></a>Planning the Heist</h2>
				<p>
					The Thieves&rsquo; Guild has kept tabs on Kellic and knows her security measures well. They depict the layout of the estate as below:
				</p>
				<div class="imagebox" id="kellic_heist_map_box">
					<img src="res/kellic_players.png" id="kellic_heist_map" alt="Kellic Heist Map"/>
					<script type="text/javascript">addNewImageViewer('kellic_heist_map');</script>
					<footnote>Figure 2.1: Kellic Heist Map</footnote>
				</div>
				<p>
					What follows are the rooms and information available to the players through the guild. It should be noted the guild does not know for certain the location of the vault, but believes it to be accessible from the study. Additionally, Dusktone suggests that the party may wish to purchase some poisons - either lethal poisons or just knockout poisons - from the local alchemist: Jaeramie Dwaine.
					</p><p>
					The estate itself is walled all around, but there is a drainage grate in the northeast corner the party should be able to use easily without being detected. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="plan_entrance_anc" class="anchor"></a>1. The Entrance</h3>
				<p>
					Dusktone believes the main entrance would be the best point of entry into the estate. There are two windows on either side of the main door, and both provide the opportunity to jump inside and slink off to side before being detected. However there will likely be guards, and detection is still possible. There is one locked door to the west leading to the dining room, which could be picked.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="plan_ballroom_anc" class="anchor"></a>2. The Ballroom</h3>
				<p>
					The ballroom has several windows which could be opened, but Dusktone does not recommend doing so, as the room is layered with magical traps that, if the party were to activate them, would alert the guards and give away their presence in the estate. Dusktone believes there is a path through the traps which would not trigger the alarm, and suggests that, if they lack a detect magic spell or something to that effect, they may be able to purchase a ring of magical detection from the enchanter, Rakul-Ko.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="plan_parlor_anc" class="anchor"></a>3. The Parlor</h3>
				<p>
					The guild was unable to determine what fortifications the Kellics use to secure the parlor. All they know is there is a locked door to the east which leads to Jaena Kellic&rsquo;s study.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="plan_dining_anc" class="anchor"></a>4. The Dining Hall</h3>
				<p>
					The dinning room also offers its windows a means of entering the estate. However Dusktone points out that the windows are not as easy to enter through without being detected. Guards patrol the room, and there are two locked doors, one leading to the study and one to the entrance. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="plan_kitchen_anc" class="anchor"></a>5. The Kitchen</h3>
				<p>
					The kitchen is typically staffed with two servants at night. They cook food for the guards and typically spend most of their time talking among themselves. Dusktone might suggest poisoning the food, which could help them put the guards in the mess hall asleep.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="plan_mess_anc" class="anchor"></a>6. The Mess Hall</h3>
				<p>
					According to Dusktone&rsquo;s recommendation, the optimal time to strike - when guard patrols will be at their smallest - would be when about half of them are eating dinner. This is good for all the other rooms, but bad for the mess hall, as it will be packed with guards. There is a door from the mess hall to the study, but the guild has been unable to determine if it is locked.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="plan_study_anc" class="anchor"></a>7. The Study</h3>
				<p>
					Dusktone believes that the vault is somehow accessible from Jaena&rsquo;s Study. Unfortunately, for obvious reasons, they have not be able to verify their suspicions. In all likelihood, there is some secret entrance to the vault - probably behind some cheesy sliding bookcase - which allows entrance to the vault.
				</p>

				<h2><a id="heist_anc" class="anchor"></a>Running the Heist</h2>
				<p>
					After taking the time to plan and prepare for the heist, the actual execution of the heist can take some interesting turns. Below is a map of the estate and various obstacles the party can encounter. All guards are normal Imperial guards CR 1/2 with 23 hp, 13 AC, and Perception 10. 
				</p>
				<div class="imagebox" id="kellic_estate_map_box">
					<img src="res/kellic.png" id="kellic_estate_map" alt="Kellic Estate Map"/>
					<script type="text/javascript">addNewImageViewer('kellic_estate_map');</script>
					<footnote>Figure 2.2: Kellic Estate Map</footnote>
				</div>

				<h3><a id="entrance_anc" class="anchor"></a>1. The Entrance</h3>
				<p>
					This room is fairly straight-forward. Two gaurds patrol the room, periodically checking behind the stairs and the going back to the table, which they lean on to talk with each other. Breaking into this room requires a DC 12 DEX (Stealth) check. The locked door is DC 8.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="ballroom_anc" class="anchor"></a>2. The Ballroom</h3>
				<p>
					As described in the planning stage, this room is trapped with an alarm spell which will activate if a party member steps on one of the red squares. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the trap, a detect magic spell only reveals the trapped/not-trapped status of adjacent squares.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="parlor_anc" class="anchor"></a>3. The Parlor</h3>
				<p>
					The parlor is fairly lightly guarded. There are only two guards. They spend most of their time sitting in front of the south door, but occasionally walk around the room. The door to the study is trapped DC 9.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="dining_anc" class="anchor"></a>4. The Dining Hall</h3>
				<p>
					Attempting to enter through the dining hall window requires a DC 16 DEX (Stealth) check. There are three guards patrolling the room. They move in a circle, traveling from the bottom of the room up to the top. There is an additional secret entrance (a small window leading to a secret celler) whose entrance from the outside can be detected with a DC 17 detection check. Detecting the entrance to the dining room (from inside the dining room) requires a DC 11 detection check.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="kitchen_anc" class="anchor"></a>5. The Kitchen</h3>
				<p>
					The kitchen staff are not on guard and are just talking to each other while they cook for the guards. If the food is poisoned, after a few minutes the staff will serve the food to the guards and serve themselves a plate each as well.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="mess_anc" class="anchor"></a>6. The Mess Hall</h3>
				<p>
					Getting throught the mess hall with guards awake requires a DC 21 DEX (Stealth) check. Additionally, the door to the south is trapped with a DC 8 1d8 spike trap.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="study_anc" class="anchor"></a>7. The Study</h3>
				<p>
					The entrance to the vault is indeed hidden by a bookcase. The switch to the bookcase is a portrait of Jaena Kellic with Countess Finna above some tables on the eastern side of the room. Pushing in the heart of Finna causes the books in the second from the right (south) bookcase to come flying off the shelves and arrange themselves in the other bookscases. The shelves of the bookcase will rise up, and the back of the case will open up as a door leading down to the vault.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="vault_anc" class="anchor"></a>8. The Vault</h3>
				<p>
					The vault contains three trapped medium chests (DC's 15, 6, and 11 from ltr, each a 1d8 poison dart trap). The large chest is trapped DC 9 with a 1d4 shock trap. On the left side of the room is a lectern which holds the journal. On either side are various journals for Kellic listing secrets and deals. 
					</p><p>
					From left to right the medium chests contain <span class="loot">55 gp, an ornately decorated, gilded, and engraved set of scales worth 91 gp (must be fenced), and two potions of lesser magicka</span> &mdash; <span class="loot">32 gp, a restored Ayleid pen worth 67 gp (must be fenced), and 2 common fire arrows</span> &mdash; <span class="loot">35 gp, a diamond-inlaid minotaur sculpture worth 142 gp, and a scroll of Dispell Magic</span>. The large chest contains <span class="loot">174 gp, a sack of gemstone marbles worth 43 gp (the bag seems very old, and is labeled, &ldquo;Jaena Kellic&rdquo; in child-like writing), a scroll of Enthrall, 1 potion of minor magicka, and a black soul gem</span>.
					</p><p>
					Note that escaping requires going through the various rooms, again without detection.
				</p>

				<h2><a id="end_anc" class="anchor"></a>The Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					The journal itself is a document of notes to contact the Daedric Prince Clavicus Vile. It does not seem immediately apparent to the reader, but the notes were written by Countess Finna and she was documenting the process by which she struck a deal with him to give herself some power over the city. She gained control by shorting the deals of the other merchant lords in the city, ensuring their failure while guaranteeing Vile&rsquo;s benefit.
					</p><p>
					When the party returns the journal to Daryn, he will offer to pay them each 80 gp to keep them silent (though this is a lowball offer, expecting them to demand higher prices for their silence - he is willing to pay 120 gp each). Otherwise he is willing to provide either scrolls or lessons for each of the following spells:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Identify</li>
					<li>Locate Object</li>
					<li>Clairvoyance</li>
					<li>Leomund&rsquo;s Secret Chest</li>
					<li>Creation</li>
				</ul>
