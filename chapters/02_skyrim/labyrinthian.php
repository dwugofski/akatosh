				<h2>Quest Overview</h2>
				<h5>XP: 1 1/2</h5>
				<p>
					With <span class="npc">Neradrys Telvanni</span> in tow, the party returns to Whiterun to discuss further actions with the Jarl. In a meeting with the Jarl, Neradrys tells the group that <span class="npc">Kinvas</span> is the leader of the recent Dragon Cult revival. Not only is Kanvas using a very powerful relic from Labyrinthian to keep the Jarl&rsquo;s troops out of ruined city, but Kinvas plans to resurrect <span class="npc">Morokei</span>, a Dragon Priest who ruled in Bromjunaar before its fall. 
					</p><p>
					Neradrys urges the Jarl to send a contingent of soldiers to Labyrinthian immediately; if Morokei is allowed to rise, he could raise an army of undead which could take over Skyrim. Although weakened, Neradrys believes he can open a tear in the blizzard long enough to send soldiers through to fight the Dragon Cult. Impressed with the party&rsquo;s seige on the Dragon Cult lair in Volunruud, he asks the party to go with the contingent.
					</p><p>
					The party, along with Neradrys and <span class="npc">Captain Fralma</span>, lay seige to Labyrinthian. While the main forces distract the Dragon Cult troops, Frelma and Neradrys suggest the party seek an alternate route into the main city, as there are too many Dragon Cultists to make a direct assault quickly. With the help of a Nordic ghost, the party finds an alternate entrance. After a sequence of trials, the group is able to enter the main city and fight their way to Kinvas and Morokei, who has indeed been resurrected.
					</p><p>
					Once Kinvas is dead and Morokei is bound, the party can collect the <span class="item">Bal Falruhn</span>.
				</p>

				<h2><a class="anchor" id="return_to_the_jarl_anc"></a>Return to the Jarl</h2>
				<p>
					After the party rescues <span class="npc">Neradrys Telvanni</span>, they can return to <span class="npc">Jarl Hormund Banner-Shield</span>, who will, considering Neradrys a co-conspirator to the Dragon Cult, initially treat Neradrys with suspicion and hostility. Neradrys explains the details he was able to learn during his captivity with the Dragon Cult. 
					</p><p>
					He explains the leader of the revival is a man named <span class="npc">Kinvas</span>. The Dragon Cult revival had apparently been going on underground for quite some time. It was not until Kinvas, who lead a small faction in Labyrinthian, found a powerful relic left there that he was able to convince the cultists to come out of hiding. With the relic, he created the blizzard surrounding Labyrinthian. He kept Neradrys in order to learn how to master the power of the relic.
					</p><p>
					Now that he believes he has acquired all the knowledge he can, Kinvas is shifting his focus back on the main goal of reviving the Dragon Cult. Unfortunately, Kinvas plans to do so by reviving one of the High Dragon Priests, <span class="npc">Morokei</span>. Kinvas believes that harnessing the power of the relic, he can resurrect Morokei. If he does so, all the undead Draugr of Labyrinthian &mdash; and possibly across all of Skyrim &mdash; will rally around Morokei as a leader and attempt to conquer Skyrim and re-establish the Dragon Cult. 
					</p><p>
					Neradrys believes his rescue will accelerate Kinvas&rsquo;s plans, as he no doubt figures that Neradrys knows how to get troops pass the blizzard. Fearing an attack, Kinvas will almost certainly begin the process of reviving Morokei. Neradrys states that he can get a group of soldiers past the blizzard, and that the Jarl should launch a seige immediately, while they still have time. 
					</p><p>
					The Jarl agrees with Neradrys, but states that he cannot rally an entire force, so it will have to be a small contingent. In light of their successin Volunruud, the Jarl asks the party if they would be willing to accompany the troops.
				</p>

				<h2><a class="anchor" id="the_labyrinthian_seige_anc"></a>The Labyrinthian Seige</h2>
				<p>
					With a contingent of fifty soldiers, the party, Neradrys, and <span class="npc">Captain Fralma</span> &mdash; the leader of the troops &mdash; move out to Labyrinthian. When they arrive, Neradrys explains that the blizzard is actually deceptively thin. It is like a sheet of cloth; ultimately thin, but as you push against it, it gets harder to push farther. All he has to do is puncture a small tear in the veil, and keep it open long enough for the party to get through. 
					</p><p>
					Once through, the troops engage the cultists outside Labyrinthian in combat. Neradrys becomes worried about how long a frontal assault will take, but Frelma states they have no other options without another way into the main city. Neradrys suggests that &mdash; for a city as old and important as Bromjunaar &mdash; there are bound to be special entrances used in case of emergencies. 
					</p><p>
					Neradrys suggests summoning a ghost to ask about an entrance. The summoned ghost states that he does know a hidden entrance to the city, but he will only tell the party if they prove worthy of the knowledge. The ancient Nords proved worth through combat, so the party must fight the ghost. Alternatively, the party may prove their worth by boasting of their success, or otherwise convincing the ghost of their worth as warriors without actually battling the ghost. 
					</p><p>
					When the ghost is convinced (the battle does not have to go until the ghost is dead), he will escort the party to the entrance of a cave that is hidden. Before they leave, Frelma offers them each 5 health potions. Neradrys tags along, explaining that he is too drained from ripping through the veil and summoning the ghost to be of much assistance in combat, but he knows the language of the ancient Nords, so he could be of help if they need any translations.
				</p>

				<h2><a class="anchor" id="the_secret_entrance_anc"></a>The Secret Entrance</h2>
				<p>
					The ghost informs the party that this cave will lead them to the trials of Bromjunaar &mdash; four trials which only one with the spirit of a true Atmoran would be able to complete. These puzzles were crafted to keep enemies of Bromjunaary out, but were common knowledge to the elites of the region.

				</imagebox>
				<h3><a id="wolf_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>1: The Wolf Room</h3>
				<p>
					The first room has two rows of seven buttons on each side of the room. On each button is the symbol of an animal. Going from top-right and clockwise, the images on the buttons are fox, fox, rabbit, snake, rabbit, snake, snake, fox, rabbit, snake, fox, rabbit, fox, snake (just random sequence of snake, rabbit, and fox). On the far end of the room is a protcullis in front of a door. Above the protcullis is the symbol of a wolf. Near the entrance of the room is a pedastle on which the following inscription is made in Atmoran:
					</p><p class="quote">
					The wolf hunts in packs, working together to eliminate its prety. So too are the Nords united; they walk the same path.
					</p><p>
					The solution to the puzzle requires the group to press a button &mdash; any button &mdash; together. When they do, the protcullis opens and they can continue on.
				</p>
				<h3><a id="bear_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>2: The Bear Room</h3>
				<p>
					The second room has a hallway in the center where the floos is covered in pressure panels that, when compressed, will cause spikes to shoot up. Lining the walls of the hallway are six buttons. On the far end of the hallway on the wall is the emblem of a bear. To the right (when facing) of the bear is a portcullin in front of a door. Near the entrance is a pedastle with the following inscription in Atmoran:
					</p><p class="quote">
					The bear is strong and fearless; it charges forward without fear of harm. Likewise the Nord does not shirk from pain, and marches assuredly into battle.
					</p><p>
					The solution to the puzzle requires a member of the group to step on a pressure plate without trying to avoid taking damage. When he or she does so, all the plates will compress without activating, the portcullis will open, and the party may continue.
				</p>
				<h3><a id="hawk_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>2: The Hawk Room</h3>
				<p>
					The third room has three platforms forming a fork shape with a chasm between them. At the far end of each platform is a button. From top to bottom they are: rabbit, snake, fish. On the far end of the room, across a chasm, is another platform, with a procullis and a door. Above the door, level with the three platforms is the emblem of a hawk. The party may simply jump down onto the lower platoform, but cannot jump back up. Near the entrance of the room is a pedastle with the inscription: 
					</p><p class="quote">
					The hawk is keen and observent. Its eye always finds its target. Likewise, a true Nord is not mislead by lies, and always knows his true enemy.
					</p><p>
					The solution to the puzzle is to throw some projectile &mdash; a rock or some such &mdash; at the eye of the hawk. The party may detect that the eye is special by making a DC 18 INT (Investigation) check. 
				</p>
				<h3><a id="owl_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>2: The Owl Room</h3>
				<p>
					The fourth room has four buttons in the four corners of the room. There is a portcullis and a door behind that. In the center of the room is a pedastle with an inscription which reads
					</p><p class="quote">
					The owl is wise and strategic. It does not persue a path thoughtlessly. Neither does a Nord go into battle without being certain of its necessity.
					</p><p>
					The solution to the puzzle is cruel in its simplicity. The portcullis can be lifted; it is not weighed down.
				</p>

				<h2><a class="anchor" id="labyrinthian_proper_anc"></a>Ruins of Labyrinthian</h2>
				<imagebox id="labyrinthian_map_box" class="doublewide noprinting">
					<img src="res/labyrinthian.png" id="labyrinthian_map" alt="Labyrinthian Map"/>
					<script type="text/javascript">addNewImageViewer('labyrinthian_map');</script>
					<footnote>Figure 1.2: Map of Labyrinthian</footnote>
				</imagebox>
				<p>
					The Dragon Cultists have been preapring for the conflict with the forces of Whiterun. They have fortrified the ruins against invasion. As a result, they have rallied their forces for strategic defense. On the downside, the enemies are anticipating attack, and surprising them is harder than normal. Fortunately, the cultists have distributed supplies for their troops, and when the party defeats an encampment they have access to some refreshing supplies which should keep them going through the city. 
					</p><p>
					As you can see from the dungeon map, with each line of troops there is a chest. These chests are equipment chests. In general they have the following supplies (the health and magicka potions are specifically mentioned for each chest, while the remaining supplies can be assumed for all):
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>Bandages</li>
					<li>10 ft. of hempen rope</li>
					<li>Three flasks of oil</li>
					<li>50 arrows</li>
					<li>10 days&rsquo; rations</li>
					<li>5 full waterskins</li>
					<li>Up to 4 leveled health potions</li>
					<li>Up to 2 leveled magicka potions</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Abatis</h4>
				<p>
					Many of the cultists have entrenched themselves using abatis (spikey barriers). Moving across an abatis (the hard way) will require a creature to expend half their movement to leap over the barrier. The leap itself will require the creature to make a DC 15 <span class="die">DEX</span> (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the creature makes it over the abatis and can continue moving. On a failed check, if the roll result was greater than 7, the creature can continue with their turn. If the result of the roll is 7 or lower, the creature ends its turn and any creature which attacks it has advantage on the attack rull until the start of its next turn.
					</p><p>
					Crossing an abatis the easy way only costs two movement spaces. Any melee attacks made across the barriers (the hard way) has disadvantage on the attack roll.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="lab_entrance_anc" class="anchor"></a>1. Entrance</h3>
				<p>
					The secret entrance the party uses to enter leads to a hidden passage which opens into the main entrance of the city of Bromjunaar (Labyrinthian). Here, two Dragon Cult spellcasters cast a warding spell on the main entrance to keep the army of Whiterun out. 
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					Initially, the fanatics will focus entirely on maintaining concentration on their spells of warding, letting the draugr and thugs fight the party. However, as the party starts whittling down the thugs, the fanatics will turn on the adventurers and join the fray. The two thugs in the back behind the barricade will focus on using ranged attacks agains the party.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					From this encounter, the party will be able to salvage 36 gold pieces. Additionally, the supply chest will have <span class="loot">2 potions of minor healing</span> and <span class="loot">2 potions of minor magicka</span>. The left and right burial urns near the north door of the room have 5 and 2 gold pieces respectively.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="lab_customs_anc" class="anchor"></a>2. Customs</h3>
				<p>
					This room once served to manage intake into the city: both peoples and goods. Shelves carved into the walls of the room served to store records of arrivals to the city. Rusted chains are dangling from the walls which once served to keep smugglers held while they awaited escorts to Bromjunaar&rsquo;s jail. 
					</p><p>
					The shelves around the room contain mostly decayed and illgible books. However one book on the shelf does appear intact. It is the journal of a cultist in charge of guarding the entrance. Most of the journal is a chronical of personal gripes and dramas, but some passages do stick out as relevant. There is a mention of several collars discovered among the rubble when the cultists first started clearing the room for occupancy. The cultist remembered them giving him the creeps just looking at them, and knowing they were always in the chest nearby made him uneasy. With the collars there was a rod which one of the higher-ups took with him back to his office to investigate.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					During battle, the infiltrators will try to keep the party clustered near the door while the fanatic casts spells and makes ranged attacks against the party members. If the party flees down the hall, the infiltrators will persue, but the fanatic will remain behind.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The northern chest will contain several <span class="loot">slave collars</span>, which the elven members of the party can equip to get past the entrance door. The fanatic will have 9 gp on his body. The southern chest is locked (DC 12), but stored inside is the following:
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>4 potions of minor healing</li>
					<li>3 potions of minor magicka</li>
					<li>52 gp</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>The Entrance Door</h4>
				<p>
					The ancient Nords were not particularly friendly towards the elves. The eastern exit to the entrance square is enchanted to prevent elves from walking into the city unless wearing a slave collar. As the party approaches the door, Nordic runes will glow along its border, and even when the door is opened, they will remain in the air, hovering in place. <span class="npc">Neradrys</span>, or any other character who can read ancient Nord will be able to translate the runes. They read as follows:
					</p><p class="quote short">
					If of elven kin you be, in these halls you won't walk free
					</p><p>
					Any Bretons or elves &mdash; Neradrys included &mdash; will be met with an impregnible magical wall of force preventing them from walking past the door without the collar. 
					</p><p>
					Once attached, the collars cannot be removed, except with the removal rod stored in room 8. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="lab_court_anc" class="anchor"></a>3. Main Court</h3>
				<p>
					Upon gaining entry to the city, new arrivals would be greeted with the enormous main court. Originally, reliefs in the walls and giant columns depicted the history and formation of the city of Bromjunaar. However age has worn down the reliefs, and the reliefs can no longer be made out. This court used to be used as the main trading center of the city.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					This encounter is divided into two sections. The front line will attack the party as soon as they walk through the entrance. However, only the draugr will make melee attacks. The thugs and the infiltrators will focus on staying behind the barriers and making ranged attacks. If the party breaks past the draugr, the four thugs on the flanks of the abatis will switch to melee attacks and move forward. If the party breaks through those thugs, the four remaining thugs will attack with melee. The infiltrators will only use melee attacks as a last resort. They will try to use the protection of the mbrriers as much as possible.
					</p><p>
					The second encounter involves the enemies to the right of the red dotted line. The party can see these enemies when they enter the room. However these enemies will not attack until a member of the party crosses the red dotted line. The tactics are the same as the first group, except that the second group of thugs will remain behind the barriers as long as possible.
				</p>
				<b4>Loot</b4>
				<p>
					The gold distribution among the enemies is as follows: 6 gp for the draugr, 30 gp for the thugs, and 6 gp for the infiltrators, for a total of 42 gp from enemies. There are six main sources of treasure: two equipment chests, three urns, and a secret chest. The top. bottom-right, and bottom-left urns contain <span class="loot">3, 4, and 4 gp</span> respectively. The left equipment chest contains <span class="loot">4 potions of minor healing and 2 potions of minor magicka</span>. The right equipment chest contains <span class="loot">3 potions of minor healing and 1 potion of minor magicka</span>.
					</p><p>
					The secret chest in the top-left corner of the room requires of DC 18 <span class="die wis">WIS</span> (Perception) check to detect. The chest has a DC 8 lock. It contains:
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>3 potions of minor healing</li>
					<li>1 potion of minor magicka</li>
					<li>87 gp</li>
					<li>A rusted engraved ancient Nordic tower shield (84 gp)</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Hidden Room</h4>
				<p>
					In the north-east corner of the room there is a passage to another room. It is hidden by rubble which has fallen and appears to block passage into the room. However a DC 16 <span class="die wis">WIS</span> (Perception) check can determine that the rocks and be moved and the passage cleared.
					</p><p>
					The room contains two chests. The first chest is on the right side of the wall and is locked DC 13. It contains
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>2 potion of minor healing</li>
					<li>2 potion of minor magicka</li>
					<li>88 gp</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To the south, under some light rubble is another hidden chest. A DC 10 <span class="die wis">WIS</span> (Perception) check will detect the chest. Another DC 14 <span class="die wis">WIS</span> (Perception) check will determine the chest is trapped. The trap is a DC 15 gas trap which inflicts 1d4 poison damage to anyone within 10 feet. It contains the following loot:
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>5 potion of minor healing</li>
					<li>2 potion of minor magicka</li>
					<li>42 gp</li>
					<li>Four mummified cats, mummified according to ancient Nordic burial practices (10 gp each)</li>
					<li>Spell of Unseen Servant</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3><a id="south_chamber_anc" class="anchor"></a>4. South Chamber</h3>
				<p>
					This room appears to be an old stock room. Some broken ancient cabinets are laying on the floor among pieces of rotted wood.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					The wights will melee attack the party when they enter while the fanatics attack with ranged weapons and spells. 
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The intact urn in the room contains <span class="loot">4 gp</span>. The encounter provides <span class="loot">7 gp</span>.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="bar_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>5. Cult Tavern</h3>
				<p>
					Casks of ale are lined up along the bottom wall, to the left, along with some cooking prep surfaces, some mugs, and a fire. It appears this room was being used as a tavern for the cultists before the seige.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					The two cultists flanking the barriers will attempt to block the party in while the cultist opposite the barrier as well as the wights and fanatic attack at range. If the party manages to break past the barrier, the wights and the remaining thug will switch to melee attacks. 
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The intact urn in the room contains <span class="loot">1 gp</span>. The encounter provides <span class="loot">11 gp</span>.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="stair_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>6. Stair Room</h3>
				<p>
					It is clear this room served more as a courtyard of sorts. However any decorations and beauty has long since faded. The cultists have their cots laid out and a fire going in the corner; this is one of their major camps.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					As with previous rooms, basic flanking strategy. The two thugs block passage. Everyone does ranged attacks. The wights and forward thugs move in if the party makes it past the first two thugs. The four end thugs break off and go around. Then the two remaining. The infiltrator does range as long as possible.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The encounter provides <span class="loot">16 gp</span>. The equipment chest contains <span class="loot">1 potion of minor healing and 1 potion of minor magicka</span>. The chest in the back of the room is locked DC 6 and contains:
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>17 gp</li>
					<li>2 potions of lesser healing</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3><a id="torture_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>7. Torture Room</h3>
				<p>
					Rusted iron cages dangle from the ceiling. Horrible torture devices line the walls. It is clear this is where the ancient Nords tortured their victims. However from the looks of the devices, that practice has been resumed.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					Basic flanking pattern. Wights are fodder. Nearest thugs break from barriers. 
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The encounter provides <span class="loot">30 gp</span>. The equipment chest contains <span class="loot">1 potion of minor healing and 1 potion of minor magicka</span>.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="lieutenants_office_anc" class="anchor"></a>8. Lieutenant&rsquo;s Office</h3>
				<p>
					This is the office of one of Kivas&rsquo;s lietenants. On the top side of the room are a couple tables with maps and charts on them detailing locations of dragon cult cells across Skyrim. The shelves on the left side of the room contain records of different financial dealings the cultists use to fund themselves. As the party enters, the lieutenant is discussing battle strategies for Morokei&rsquo;s army once the ritual is complete.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					The wights try to keep the party near the door. The fanatics try to get to a safe distance and attack with spells. The champion goes in for melee.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The encounter provides <span class="loot">12 gp</span>. Additionally, on the lieutenant&rsquo;s body are notes from Kivas outlining the plans for the ritual of summoning Morokei. It appears that Morokei has been in slumber awaiting the return of Alduin, the World-Eater. Each night the servants of Morokei imbue him with their energy to sustain him. Kivas believes by using the new relic&rsquo;s power he can channel more energy into Morokei and awaken him. This news gives Neradrys an idea &mdash; something about harnessing the power of the draugr to bind Morokei, but he doesn&rsquo;t know exactly how to make it work. The large chest to the bottom is both locked (DC 7) and trapped (DC 9 1d4 hand spike trap). The chest contains 
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>164 gp</li>
					<li>8 potions of minor healing</li>
					<li>3 potions of lesser healing</li>
					<li>12 lesser ice arrows (+2d4 cold)</li>
					<li>A carefully crafted ebony rose worth 105 gp</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Secret Vault</h4>
				<p>
					Behind the lieutenant&rsquo;s office is a vault containing much of the treasure accumulated by the cultists. Rather than being locked, there is a small lever behind the top bookshelf which opens the concealed passage &mdash; the passage looks just like a plain rock wall while closed (though a DC 11 <span class="die wis">WIS</span> (Perception) check may see it). A DC 15 <span class="die wis">WIS</span> (Perception) or <span class="die int">INT</span> (Investigation) check may detect the lever. 
					</p><p>
					Each chest is trapped with a DC 12 1d8 10-foot poison gas trap. When one trap is activated, all armed traps activate, so the poison gas can deal as much as 3d8 damage to all nearby creatures. All chests contain 10 bars of solid gold, each worth 200 gp, but players may only carry as many bars as their STR modifier. The top chest contains <span class="loot">19 gp, 1 potion of minor magicka, and 1 filled common soul gem</span>. The middle contains <span class="loot">26 gp, an alarm spell scroll, and 3 potions of lesser healing</span>. The bottom contains <span class="loot">24 gp, 4 potions of lesser magicka, 4 potions of minor healing, and a tablet engraved in ancient norid writing worth 112 gp.</span>.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="slanted_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>9. Slanted Room</h3>
				<p>
					The awkward shape of this room is due to a collapse in the structures supporting the rock overhead, which has created a steep slope to the ceiling. Lining the walls of the room are black sarcophagi, which seems to be where the draugr have been buried. 
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					Standard flanking practice, with the draugr in the second contingent going forward with melee attacks once the party breaches the front line.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The encounter provides <span class="loot">40 gp</span>. The supply chest contains <span class="loot">3 potions of minor healing</span>. The urn in the top-left corner provides <span class="loot">2 gp</span>.
				</p>
				<h4>Bottom Hidden Room</h4>
				<p>
					A DC 14 detection check will reveal that one of the sarcophagi against the bottom wall of the room has been removed and replaced with care, unlike the many other sarcophagi which have either had their lids splayed across the floor or are still sealed. The sarcophagus is actuall a passage into a hidden room. This room has walls lined with sarcophagi. Inside each sarcophagus is a draugr which will break out and attack as soon as a party member enters the room. 
					</p><p>
					The chest in this room contains <span class="loot">7 gp and 1 potion of minor magicka</span>.
				</p>
				<h4>Top Hidden Room</h4>
				<p>
					A DC 10 detection check will reveal that one of the sarcophagi against the top wall of the room has been removed and replaced with care, unlike the many other sarcophagi which have either had their lids splayed across the floor or are still sealed. The sarcophagus is actuall a passage into a hidden room. This room has a chest with two urns to either side. The chest has a DC 9 1d4 spark trap.
					</p><p>

				</p>

				<p class="note">
					Due to how long it was taking the part to travel through the dungeon, I remade the map. I eliminated rooms 10-14, made the secret door to 9.2 a regular door, and created a path from 9.2 to 15.1, sealing the passage branching off to 12.3 and the one to 14.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="flooded_corridors_anc" class="anchor"></a>10. Flooded Corridors</h3>
				<p>
					Whatever purpose this room served in the past has been washed away. The floor of the room is flooded, and a gentle current pushes the flow of water to the bottom of the room. The room is a maze of corridors out of which draugr and cultists ambush the party.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					All enemies except the fanatic and infiltrator go in and melee the party when they enter. The fanatic and infiltrator will attack at range. Once all but two enemies from the forward encounter, or if the party enters the leftmost section and is detected, the three remaining enemies will attack the party.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The encounter provides <span class="loot">30 gp</span>. The urn in the bottom-left corner contains <span class="loot">4 gp</span>. The chest in the bottom-left corner has a DC 13 1d4 spike trap. It contains
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>26 gp</li>
					<li>2 potions of lesser magicka</li>
					<li>A box of Atmoran undergarments worth 10 gp</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The secret chest to the north is underwater and requires a DC 8 detection check to notice it. The lock itself is DC 8 as well. It contains
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>39 gp</li>
					<li>A filled lesser soul gem</li>
					<li>A scroll of burning hands</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>10.1 Hidden Side Room</h4>
				<p>
					A DC 20 detection check will reveal a hidden room off to the side. This room contains a chest with <span class="loot">11 gp, and a scroll of Mirror Image</span>.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="pantry_anc" class="anchor"></a>11. Pantry</h3>
				<p>
					Shelves, crates, and barrels of food supplies and rations line the walls of this room. Clearly its was used by the cultists as a pantry.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					Standard barricaded defense pattern with thug pawns.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					This encounter yields <span class="loot">8 gp</span>. The top-right and bottom-left urns contain <span class="loot">3 and 2 gp</span> respectively.
				</p>
				<h4>11.1 Mages&rsquo;s Lab</h4>
				<p>
					In the hallways, a DC 13 detection or INT (Arcana) check will allow a character to detect a hidden passageway leading to a laboratory where cultists are disposing of evidence by burning books and neutralizing potions.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					When the party enters the room, the fanatics will be occupied, and thus will not immediately notice that the party has entered. The thugs, however, are acting as guards and are on alert against intrusions. The battle strategy is a typical barricaded defense strategy.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					Each of the bookshelves can be searched. A DC 15 INT (Investigation) check made on each bookshelf search will find spell scrolls within. The number of scrolls found equals the number of successful checks. The scrolls discovered are (in order):
				</p>
				<ul class="bulletted">
					<li>Aid</li>
					<li>See Invisibility</li>
					<li>Remove Curse</li>
					<li>Prayer of Healing</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3><a id="thoroughfare_anc" class="anchor"></a>12. Thoroughfare</h3>
				<p>
					The party enters an enormous chamber, will ceilings vaulted so high it&rsquo;s hard to remember you&rsquo;re underground. This is the burial thoroughfare for the city, where heroes would be paraded before their funerals. At the end of the thoroughfare the party arrives at the <em>Founders&rsquo; Crypt</em>, where the original settlers of Brumjunaar are buried. They are no longer in the more public areas of the city. They&rsquo;re in the sacred vaults. These walls still vibrate with the mystical energy that lingers from the rituals of the original Dragon Cult.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					Infiltrators from above will try to rain arrows upon the party while thugs attack on the ground. Battling on the thoroughfare takes place in stages, with different waves waiting for the party to pass through the previous arch. The final section contains a battle with a horde of dragur swarming the party while cultists fire with arrows from above. The champion will wait until roughly half of the draugr are dead before moving in to challenge the party himself.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The first wave yields <span class="loot">39 gp</span>. The second has <span class="loot">43 gp</span>. The third has <span class="loot">30 gp</span>. The fourth has <span class="loot">43 gp</span>. The last room yields <span class="loot">31 gp</span>.
				</p>

				<p class="note">
					See note after section 9.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="hall_stories_anc" class="anchor"></a>15. Hall of Stories</h3>
				<p>
					Like most ancient Nord ruins, Labyrinthian contains a hall of stories, recording the history of the city. This hallways serves as a reminder of the significance of the Dragon Cult to those approaching the main temple. 
				</p>
				<h4>Reading the Wall</h4>
				<p>
					The last segement of the hall of stories contains a record of the last few years of the Dragon Cult. It explains that shortly after the fall of Alduin, the high priests of the Dragon Cult prepared themselves for lichdom, and went to sleep in anticipation of Alduin&rsquo;s return. If Neradrys reads this segment, he will devise the same theory on defeating Morokei as in room 8.
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					When the battle starts, all enemies in the hallway will move towards the party, except for those at the end of the hallway, who will remain back until the party gets within range (for the rangers) or into the room (the melee).
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The equipment chest contains <span class="loot">3 potions of minor healing</span> and <span class="loot">2 potions of minor magicka</span>. The encounter yields <span class="loot">51 gp</span>
				</p>
				<h4>15.1: Hidden Room Loot</h4>
				<p>
					The large chest on the south end of the room has a DC 6 1d4 poison dart trap. It contains <span class="loot">79 gp, 1d12 lesser fire arrows, 1 minor health potion, an ancient nord burial mask worth 106 gp, and 1 potion of lesser healing</span>. The urn contains <span class="loot">5 gp</span>.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="main_temple_anc" class="anchor"></a>16. Main Temple</h3>
				<p>
					The most revered chamber in all of Skyrim for the ancient Dragon Cult, the main temple of Bromjunaar still hums with the sinister magic of the cult. Anyone with the slightest hint of magickal sensitivity feels a wave of necromantic and blood magic rush over them upon entering the room. 
					</p><p>
					The room has three layers. On the first floor at the far end of the room from the door, there is a bool of water from water leaking through cracks in the far wall. The second layer is slightly more elevated from the first - roughly the height of the average person. Characters can climb from the first level to the second. The third lawyer - the balcony to the north end of the room - is much higher than the second and cannot be climed easily.
					</p><p>
					At (A) the ritual to awaken Morokei is taking place. All the dragon cultists, including Kivas, are kneeling before the corpse of Morokei, strands of red energy leeching off of them, into his body, floating above an alter. (B) denotes the pool of water in the chamber. The pool is not deep, and the water only rises to slightly shin-level of the average person at it deepest (against the wall). (C)&rsquo;s denote outcropping balconies, decorated with arches that resemble dragon heads. (D) denotes the uppermost level
					</p><p>
					The door to the north is locked (DC 22).
				</p>
				<h4>Battle Tactics</h4>
				<p>
					At first the thugs will attempt to delay the party while the ritual complete. When the party approaches the ritual, the aura of magicka around Morokei will dispell, killing all the cultists in the room (including any surviving thugs) when it washes over them. Morokei will awaken, annoyed the party interrupted his meal. The door will then close behind the party and seal with a magical aura.
					</p><p>
					Morokei&rsquo;s tactics will typically revolve around avoiding player attaks and moving around the room, typically via blinking and hovering. He will open with his lich crystal attack if reasonable and wait for the second ability to clock in before casting again, using his turns for spells and his necrobolt attack. Any character wearing a slave collar will be unable to avoid the necrobolt attack, if he/she is the target of one.
					</p><p>
					Should Neradrys deem the battle too risky (e.g. should he fall to 5 hit points, if he should fall to 0 hit points and be revived - up to DM&rsquo;s discretion ) he will spend a turn concentrating on his ritual to bind Morokei. On his next turn after, he will sacrifice himself to bind Morokei to the alter indefinitely. He will thrust his hands forward, bright blue whisps resembling magefire will shoot forth, surrounding Morokei in a whirlwind, directing him back to the alter. As he sustains the blast, however, his hands start to be eroded by the flames, and eventually his entire body is funneled through the beam into the whirlwind. Once complete, an aura of magicka will surround the alter, trapping Morokei on it, asleep.
					</p><p>
					After that, the soldiers from Whiterun will open the doors and see the party. Captain Fralma will congradulate the party on their success, and (if the party did not explore room 8), tell the party they found a room back aways with detailed reports of Dragon Cult activities across Skyrim, as well as the rods to remove the slave collars (they were hoping Neradrys would know what they were). On behalf of the Jarl, the High King, and all the Nords, Fralma thanks the party for their assistance. 
					</p><p>
					If the party manages to vanquish Morokei, his remains, staff, and apparel will dissolve into a cloud of red haze and seep into the cracks of the room. Additionally, the party will receive 1 bonus XP for killing Morokei instead of having Neradrys bind him.
				</p>
				<h4>Loot</h4>
				<p>
					Kivas&rsquo;s corpse holds the Bal Falruhn, as well as the key to the north door. The corpses contain <span class="loot">128 gp</span> (most of it on Kivas). The boss chest contains: <span class="loot">109 gp, a (dull) Dragon Cult ceremonial knife worth 92 gp, 1 potion of minor magicka, 1 potion of lesser healing, 1 potion of lesser healing, a potion of ultimate healing, a scroll of Erupting Earth, 4 common ice arrows, and 10 common fire arrows</span>.
