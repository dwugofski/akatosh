				<h2>Quest Overview</h2>
				<h5>XP: 1/4</h5>
				<p>
					<span class="npc"><a href="#Skinda_Pure-Spring">Skinda Pure-Spring</a></span> is looking for assistance with a delivery of healing potions <span class="npc"><a href="#Acolyte_Ginfor">Acolyte Ginfor</a></span> was supposed to send out to the <span class="loc">Western Outpost</span> earlier. Unfortunately he forgot, and the next courier is not due for several more days. With the recent uptick in Dragon Cult raids, the guards need the potions quickly. If the party would be willing to deliver the potions for her, she would be willing to whip up one of her special <a href="../over/index.php?section=mag#sprigganwood_ring">Sprigganwood Rings</a>. 
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="talking_with_skinda_anc" class="anchor"></a>Talking with Skinda</h3>
				<p>
					Skinda is very busy with managing the temple services, so, while she does over the expected greetings for Kyne etcetera etcetera, she is not particularly enthusiastic about proselytizing to the party. When the party talks to her, she will remark that they look like strong adventurers. Maybe they could help her with an issue she has.
					</p><p>
					Her pupil, Acolyte Ginfor, forgot to hire a courier to deliver some healing potions to a garrison of guards west of Whiterun. With only the two of them running the temple, neither of them can make the delivery. But if the party members would make the delivery on her behalf, she would be willing to reward them with one of her famous <a href="../over/index.php?section=mag#sprigganwood_ring">Sprigganwood Rings</a>. 
					</p><p>
					If the party agrees, she will provide them with ten <a href="../over/index.php?section=mag#healing_potions">minor healing potions</a> to deliver, along with directions to the western outpost.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a id="the_western_outpost_anc" class="anchor"></a>The Western Outpost</h3>
				<p>
					As the party approaches the western outpost, they see signs of a fight. They notice the bodies of several Dragon Cultist corpses lying down around the cabin. If inspected, a DC 5 INT (Investigation) check will determine the Dragon Cultists fought with a group of trained soldiers, probably the Whiterun guards posted here. There are no guard bodies strewn about, but they do see bloody drag marks leading into the cabin. A DC 10 INT (Investigation) check will reveal that whatever fight took place here, it happened a couple days ago.
					</p><p>
					When the party enters the cabin, they will see several guard corpses laid out about the cabin. They have been mutilated in the same way as the guard corpses in <a href="#neradrys_research_cabin">Neradry&rsquo;s Research Cabin</a>. As laid in that section, characters can make skill checks to determine why they have been mutilated in this way. However if a member of the party gets within five feet of a corpse, all the corpses will turn into <span class="enemy">Draugr</span>.
					</p><p>
					The skin on the bodies shrivels up and turns grey. Their bodies become emaciated and gaunt. Their eyes grow cloudy, white, and then eventually blaze with haunting blue light. They pick up their weapons and prepare to engage the party. The encounter will be a <span class="enc">medium encounter</span> of Draugr. The number of guard corpses will be the number of Draugr in the encounter. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="the_cabin_in_the_tundra_reward_anc" class="anchor"></a>Reward</h3>
				<p>
					When the party returns to Skinda, she thanks them for their assistance and tells them she will send Ginfor to the guards&rsquo; barracks to dring the issue to their attention. As promised, she gives the party a <span class="item">Sprigganwood Ring</span> and 4 gp per person per tier.
