				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					During the Merethic Era, humans from the northern continent of <b>Atmora</b> migrate south to the northern-most region of Tamriel: <b>Skyrim</b>. There they encounter the native elves: the Falmer (Snow Elves) and Dwemer (Dwarves). Several migrations occurr over the years, and the Atmorans build a massive underground city, Saarthal, as the center of their new civilization. For unknown reasons, despite peaceful relations, the Falmer suddenly turn on the Atmorans and attack Saarthal, sacking it in a night. In relatiation, the Atmoran <span class="npc">Ysgramor</span> sails home, where he rallies an army known as the Five Hundred Companions to slaughter the Falmer. 
					</p><p>
					The Companions drive the Falmer to the brink of extinction, sacking their cities and forcing them to seek refuge with the Dwemer. However in addition to revenge, the Five Hundred Companions bring with them dragons from their homeland. While the dragons and their worshippers - the Dragon Cult - remain in power for many decades, eventually the Atmorans revolt against them. Thanks to an intercession by the goddess Kyne, the Atmorans are able to gain the upper hand and defeat the dragons and the Dragon Cult. 
					</p><p>
					After many centuries, the Atmorans cut ties with their now-desolate homeland, naming themselves Nords and strengthening their new civilization. Their leader, <span class="npc">High King Vrage</span>, begins a series of invasions into High Rock and Morrowind, establishing <spane class="u">The First Empire of the Nords</span>. However after a century and a half, internal conflict comes to Skyrim. After the death of <span class="npc">High King Borgas</span>, the Nords fail to agree upon a successor, instead battling each other for control of the Empire. This period of infighting in Skyrim called the War of Succession allows the other regions of Tamriel to wrest themselves from Nordic control. Eventually <span class="npc">Jarl Olaf One-Eye</span> of Whiterun manages to unite the Nords, but not until after the decimation of the First Empire of the Nords. 
					</p><p>
					While Skyrim has been blessed by centuries of internal peace following the resolution of the War of Succession, many of the Nords have grown restless. They feel that expansion is imperative; the Nords need to reassert their dominance on the weaker races. However the High King has been unwilling to make any overtures of aggression. Many Nords look back to the time of the Dragon Cult and the obliteration of the Falmer. They believe that a return to dragon worship is exactly what the Nordic people need in order to regain their rightful dominance. Thus in the shadows of the countryside, various secret sects of a Dragon Cult revival have grown.

				<h2><a id="whiterun_overview_anc" class="anchor"></a>City Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Located in central Skyrim, Whiterun is a hub of trade and commerce both to, through, and within the region. This has made the city the most cosmopolitan city in Skyrim, despite the capitol being in Windhelm. Most of the commerce takes place outside the city walls, with the inner city reserved for residences, simple shops, and other domestic necessities along with the Jarl's castle: Dragonsreach.
					</p><p>
					Whiterun is located on a raised hill in the middle of the central plains of Skyrim, allowing the city to be visible for miles. As well, it is located along a stream that runs down the mountain slope, supplying fresh running water to the citizens within the walls.

				<h3><a id="dragonsreach_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 1: Dragonsreach</h3>
				<p>
					Dragonsreach is the imposing keep at the summit of the Whiterun hill. According to legend, Jarl Olaf imprisoned the dragon <span class="npc">Numinex</span> within it for years. While the dragon's prison is off-limits and strongly guarded, citizens can enter the main area of the castle to talk with the Jarl. Below is a list of the relevant characters in the keep.
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li class="heading">The Court:</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Jarl_Hormund_Banner-Shield"></a>Jarl Hormund Banner-Shield</span> (m. Nord) is the Jarl of Whiterun. He spends most of his time holding court with his people and his steward. For a Nord, he is not particularly arrogant or stubborn. While he does try to be impartial and objective in his dealings, he is often quick to arrive at decisions and slow to change them. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Flortis_Gavinian"></a>Flortis Gavinian</span> (m. Imperial) is the steward of Whiterun. While Flortis comes off as a weasley pollitician, he is actually concerned with the well-being of Whiterun, his home. It is just that his childhood in Cyrodiil has lead to him adopting an insincere and oily disposition when talking to strangers or new people.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Baregh_gra-Udalak"></a>Baregh gra-Udalak</span> (f. Orsimer) is the housecarl of Whiterun. An orphan from an unknown tribe, Baregh is constantly trying to prove herself. Despite being housecarl to the Jarl, she thinks she has yet to prove herself in combat, which makes her very aggressive to anyone she sees as challenging her prowess.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Daeniella_Lavina"></a>Daeniella Lavina</span> (f. Breton) is the court wizard of Whiterun. Obsessed with her studies, Daeniella comes off as aloof and uncaring to matters of court and state. This perception is not entirely inaccurate, as she would pursue any cause which would increase her knowledge, even if it meant betraying her Jarl.

				<h3><a id="gildergreen_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 2: The Gildergreen</h3>
				<p>
					During the early days of Whiterun, worhippers of Kyne located an uunderground sanctuary to the east housing an enormous, ancient tree. They sensed the magic of Kyne in its roots, and prayed to it. Their faith was rewarded with a seedling, which they took and planted in the city. That seedling grew into the enormous Gildergreen tree located in the middle of the city. 
				</p>
				<h3><a id="jorrvaskr_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 3: Jorrvaskr and the Skyforge</h3>
				<p>
					Jorrvaskr is the mead hall and hedquarters of the Companions, a group of warrior mercenaries who trace their succession back to the Five Hundred Companions of Ysgramor. The hall itself is an overturned Atmoran ship that was part of Ysgramor's fleet. According to legend the crew carried the ship accross land to the site of the Skyforge, where the city of Whiterun would later be founded.
					</p><p>
					Jorrvaskr is composed of three areas accessible to the public. The main building has the mead hall, where most of the Companions, including <span class="npc"><a href="#Aegvund">Aegvund</a></span> and <span class="npc"><a href="#Brivna_the_Harbinger">Brivna</a></span> can be found at some point during the day. It is a large room &mdash; practically the size of the building itself, as the off-limits sleeping areas are underground &mdash; with a fire pit in the center surrounded by a U-shaped table with benches for sitting. The table has food and mead on it constantly, but the public is not welcome to eat at the table unless invited.
					</p><p>
					Around back are the training grounds, where the Companions spar and practice their swordplay. Most of the active Companions will be out here, including <span class="npc"><a href="#Karvas_the_Hunter">Karvas</a></span>. Above the training grounds, up some stairs to the north, is the Skyforge: the ancient forge believed to have been created by the gods. Here <span class="npc"><a href="#Vinda">Vinda</a></span> spends her time crafting Skyforge Steel weapons for the Companions. Sometimes <span class="npc"><a href="#Brivna_the_Harbinger">Brivna</a></span> visits to talk to Vinda during the day.
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li class="heading">The Circle:</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Brivna_the_Harbinger"></a>Brivna the Harbinger</span> (f. Nord) is the Harbinger of the Companions. She is responsible for deciding the general direction of the Companions. She is rather new to the position, with the old Harbinger, Jolkyn Earth-Hill, having passed away less than a year ago. While she struggles with a lack of confidence, she does not let that show to her fellow Companions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Karvas_the_Hunter"></a>Karvas the Hunter</span> (m. Nord) is one of the three most elite members of the Companions, and is heavily involved in the operations and contracts of the group. Annoyed that he was not chosen to be the next Harbinger, Karvas has been trying to undermine <span class="npc"><a href="#Brivna_the_Harbinger">Brivna</a></span> since her appointment. Brivna knows this, but Karvas has been too crafty in his dealings and if she were to act out against him, she would have to deal with a civil war within the Companions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Aegvund"></a>Aegvund</span> (m. Nord) is one of the three most elite members of the Companions, and is heavily involved in the operations and contracts of the group. The least ambitious of the three elite circle members, Aegvund often acts as council to both <span class="npc"><a href="#Brivna_the_Harbinger">Brivna</a></span> and <span class="npc"><a href="#Karvas_the_Hunter">Karvas</a></span> in their feud. He tries his best to ensure the contension does not affect the operations of the Companions.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Vinda"></a>Vinda</span> (f. Nord) is a blacksmith for the Companions and uses the Skyforge to make weapons for them. Her position as Companions' Blacksmith has earned her a place in the Circle, despite the fact that she does not fight particularly well. While she does not participate in the Circle meetings, and is only considered a member through formality, she does share council with <span class="npc"><a href="#Brivna_the_Harbinger">Brivna</a></span> in her command over the Companions. In fact, because she is not considered a Circle elite, many of the Companions feel they can come to her with issues and she will not judge them.

				<h3><a id="temple_of_kyne_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 4: The Temple of Kyne</h3>
				<p>
					The Temple of Kyne is where worshippers to the goddess Kyne come to pray. There is a shrine to Kyne at the center of the temple. Praying at the shrine cures all disease and grants a +1 bonus to the character's <b class="die save str">STR</b> score, but removes any benefits from other gods. Additionally, the priestess can heal characters free of charge and cure diseases. As well, the High Priestess is known as the city enchantress.

Nord) is a Kyne priestess who has somewhat lost the path of perfect, submissive faith and has become trapped in the mundane cycle of maintaining a temple.

					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Acolyte_Ginfor"></a>Acolyte Ginfor</span> (m. Nord) is a sincere devotee to Kyne, but has failed to make it up the ranks due to his fumbling nature an seeming inability to do anything right.

					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Filma_Many-Miles"></a>Filma Many-Miles</span> (f. Nord) is a cheery, optimistic Nord pilgrim to the Gildergreen. She has an obnoxiously bubbly personality and has a hard time finding serious fault with anything.

				<h3><a id="hall_of_the_dead_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 5: The Hall of the Dead</h3>
				<p>
					The Hall of the Dead is where citizens of Whiterun are buried. Beneath the ground, there are extensive catacombs which hold the bodies or funeral urns of the dead. The Hall of the Dead is both the workplace and home to the city's priest of Arkay, <span class="npc"><a href="#Priest_Vronjar">Vronjar</a></span>. He is responsible for preparing the bodies and blessing them to prevent resurrection. The Hall of the Dead also contains a shrine to Arkay. Praying at the shrine cures all disease and grants +2 HP per character level, but removes any benefits from other gods. 
					<ul class="untabbed">

							<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Priest_Vronjar"></a>Priest Vronjar</span> (m. Nord) is the priest of Arkay in Whiterun's Hall of the Dead. He is a senile old man who spends most of his time simply "going through the motions" of his day-to-day responsibilities.

				<h3><a id="the_bannered_mare_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 6: The Bannered Mare</h3>
				<p>
					The Bannered Mare is the primary inn in Whiterun. It primarily serves to give people a place to stay while they pass through town. A bed costs 10 gp/night. However in addition to a bed, there is a kitchen/bar which serves mead for 5 gp and cabbage soup for 5 gp.

						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Bragmar"></a>Bragmar</span> (m. Nord) is the bartender at the Bannered Mare. He is married to Shaffi, but is a much more social counterpart to her. In fact, the Bannered Mare is actually his family's inn. He lets Shaffi run things because he's pretty naive, and she has convinced him that, if he were to run the inn, it would go out of business. Ironically, his eagerness to talk to patrons instead of focusing on work is what convinces people to keep coming back, instead of going to <span class="loc"><a href="hunters_meadery_anc">The Hunter's Meadery</a></span>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="npc"><a class="anchor" id="Baenglin"></a>Baenglin</span> (m. Bosmer) is a resident of the Bannered Mare, staying there for a few weeks while the storms to the north quiet down. He's as chatty and humorous as any Bosmer, and loves gossiping about the various people in Whiterun.

				<h3><a id="hunters_meadery_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 7: The Hunter's Meadery</h3>
				<p>
					The Hunter's Meadery is an old tavern in Whiterun. Unlike <span class="loc"><a href="#the_bannered_mare_anc">The Bannered Mare</a></span>, The Hunter's Meadery is entirely devoted to selling alcohol. However recently business has been slow, since people prefer to visit <span class="loc"><a href="#the_bannered_mare_anc">The Bannered Mare</a></span> for the jovial atmosphere <span class="npc"><a href="#Bragmar">Bragmar</a></span> creates.

He figured establishing a tavern in Skyrim would be a huge boon for business, but he falsely assumed that carying a variety of alcohols would increase his appeal to the Nords. Ultimately Nords prefer cheap mead and lively conversation to expensive mead and burgeoise airs.

Ultimately he just plays for food, lodging, and the Argonian ale Gunmar keeps. However he's thinking of moving on later. Humming-Tail prefers to play in places with more patrons, where he can put his charms to better use and acquire bedmates more readily. He is equally interested in sleeping with men and women, and will hit on any "good-looking" member of the party as they come up to him. However, if an ugly party member wishes to sleep with Humming-Tail, he or she must pay 25 gp to do so.

					Kyne's Gardens are the gardens in the southern part of the city which are tended to by the priests, priestesses, and pilgrims of Kyne. While many couples in the city use it as a romantic setting, some of the criminal underground use it as a location for clandestine meetings.
