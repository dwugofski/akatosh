				<h2>Quest Overview</h2>
				<h5>XP: 3/4</h5>
				<p>
					In order to reach Labyrinthian, the group must hire a caravaner from one of the major cities in Tamriel. This caravan will take them up to the ruins, only to discover that a powerful blizzard blocks the path. The party will then have to travel to Whiterun to wait out the storm. 
					</p><p>
					However the people of Whiterun will explain to the party that the storm has been blowing over the ruins for weeks, and caravans to Morthal have had to take longer routes. The Jarl has been looking into the matter, but with no success, due to the recent revival of the <span class="enemy">Dragon Cult</span> in the area. The Jarl has had to divert troops and resources to combatting the cult, and has been unable to spare anyone to investigate the blizzard.
					</p><p>
					<span class="npc"><a href="#Jarl_Hormund_Banner-Shield">Jarl Hormund Banner-Shield</a></span> suspects <span class="npc">Neradrys Telvanni</span> &mdash; a Telvanni wizard &mdash; is responsible for the storm. He sends the group to investigate the cabin Neradrys and his research assistants were using to conduct their research into weather control. 
					</p><p>
					The cabin is guarded by the Dragon Cult, but Neradrys is not inside. When the party delivers this news to the Jarl, he tasks them with rooting out the Dragon Cult cell within the city to find answers. The investigation will reveal that Neradrys is in the Nordic ruins of Volunruud.
				</p>
				
				<h2><a id="starting_the_journey_anc" class="anchor"></a>Starting the Journey</h2>
				<p>
					The journey into Skyrim to Labyrinthian can start in any major city. The party can find a caravan and hire them to get them to Labyrinthian. The cost of hiring the caravan is 10 gold/day. To estimate the duration of the trip, use the rule of thumb that the journey between any two cities takes 2-3 days. From Bruma, the estimation is about 6 days (three to Falkreath through the mountains, then 3 to Labyrinthian).
					</p><p>
					Once per day on the journey, you can roll <span class="die">1d10</span> to determine whether the group is attacked by bandits. The result of the roll is as shown below:

				<h2><a id="finding_labyrinthian_anc" class="anchor"></a>Finding Labyrinthian</h2>
				<p>
					As the party's caravan approaches the path up the mountains leading to Labyrinthian, they will be hit by a powerful snow storm: the strongest blizzard the caravaner has ever seen. Unfortunately going the other way around doesn't seem to work. The caravaner will suggest heading over to Winterhold in order to wait out the storm. 
					</p><p>
					On the path the Whiterun, the party will encounter a <span class="enc">medium encounter</span> comprised of <span class="enemy">Dragon Cult</span> enemies.
					</p><p>
					Upon arriving in Whiterun, the party can stay at the inn. The town will be rife with rumors about the storm on the pass to Morthal that has been blocking the caravans. Apparently the Jarl has been looking into it, but most of the forces have been devoted to battling a surge of bandits and strange cultists that have been showing up around the countryside. The last group sent to investigate apparently never made it back.
					</p><p>
					When the party approaches <span class="npc">Jarl Hormund Banner-Shield</span> he will tell them that he has been investigating the storms around Labyrinthian, and they will simply have to wait. When pressed, the Jarl will reveal that he believes the storm is a result of some experiments run by <span class="npc">Neradrys Telvanni</span>, a Telvanni wizard who has been investigating weather control magicka. 
					</p><p>
					The recent revival of a <span class="enemy">Dragon Cult</span> sect has occupied most of his standing guards, but he sent a contingent to investigate Neradrys's research lab &mdash; a cabin to the south-east of Winterhold. The guards are long overdue for a report, but the Jarl can't spare any more troops to investigate. But since the party appears like a group of people who can handle themselves, he'll send them off to investigate the disappearance of the contingent and bring back whatever information they can about Neradrys.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a class="anchor" id="neradrys_research_cabin" class="anchor"></a>Neradrys's Research Cabin</h3>
				<p>
					The party heads over to Neradrys's Research Cabin on a trip that takes about 8 hours. As they approach the cabin, they can see a number of Nords walking around the cabin, clearly protecting it. All the Nords are members of the <span class="enemy">Dragon Cult</span>, but they don't wear the clothing indicating this. Instead they appear in the garb of farmworkers.
					</p><p>
					The Dragon Cult members will not attack on sight. Instead they will greet the party with suspicion, asking them what they are doing and why they are approaching the cabin. The cult members will claim to be farm hands who have been waiting for Neradrys to return to pay them, but won't be very receptive to questions. If the party presses too hard, the Nords will attack. 
					</p><p>
					When the cult members attack, reinforcments &mdash; wearing the typical robes and masks of the <span class="enemy">Dragon Cult</span> &mdash; will come from the inside the cabin. Overall, the encounter will be a <span class="enc">hard encounter</span>, but due to numbers, not so much the difficulty of individuals within the members' group. The cultists attempt to surround the party in order to give themselves an advantage.

				<p>
					Once the cult members have been defeated, the party can enter the cabin to look at what's inside. The interior of the cabin is in a state of disarray. Books and papers are strewn about the floor, torn off the desks and selves. As well, the drawers in the sleeping area are haphazrdly opened, with clothes in heaps below them. It appears someone was rummaging through the house looking for something. The cabin also contains the bodies of previous guards sent by the Jarl. It appears the cultists have been operating upon and mutilating the corpses. 
					</p><p>
					If the party attempts to discern why the corpses were mutilated, a DC 8 <b class="die save int">INT</b> (Investigation) check will reveal that the corpses appear to be in stages of preparation according to some ritual. A subsequent (and automatic, in the case of a successful investigation check) DC 10 <b class="die save int">INT</b> (History) check will reveal that the preparation ritual is consistent with those for the <span class="enemy">Draugr</span> of the ancient Nords. 
					</p><p>
					Lastly, rummaging through the papers on the floor will reveal a note from the cultists with the following statement: 
				</p>
				<quote>
					Neradrys says he needs a special book to complete his research on the Bal Falruhn. &ldquo;Ozma&rsquo;s Compendium on Blizzards&rdquo; or something like that. Take a group back to the research cabin to find it. <br/><br/>&mdash; Effnir &mdash;
				</quote>
				<p>
					The party can then return to the Jarl with this information. He will provide them with 50 gold each for their efforts.
				</p>
				
				<h3><a class="anchor" id="finding_neradrys_anc" class="anchor"></a>Tracking Down Neradrys</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="npc">Jarl Hormund Banner-Shield</span> will tell the party that they need to locate <span class="npc">Neradrys Telvanni</span> for investigation. He believes the <span class="enemy">Dragon Cult</span> members within the city probably know his location, but they are deep underground. Every time the Jarl attempts to send guards to invesitgate, the cult cell goes deeper underground. The party will have to track down the cult themselves. 
					</p><p>
					The Jarl will recommend the group starts by going to the <span class="loc"><a href="#section 1_2_6">Bannered Mare</a></span> to investigate any Dragon Cult activities in the city. Alternatively, the party can investiage by interviewing people throughout the city. Depending on whom the party talks to, they may be pointed to <span class="npc">Ornhar Wall-Shaker</span>, who has been acting weirdly for the past several days. The guards interviewed him, but haven&rsquo;t learned anything conclusive about him.
					</p><p>
					Ornhar is a member of the Dragon Cult; he acts as a relay for information collected by the spy network. As a result, he&rsquo;s been meeting with strange people &mdash; gaurds, priests, merchants, etc. &mdash; and it has aroused curiosity in some of the more observant people in the city. 
					</p><p>
					Every night, Ornhar goes into his cellar behind his house (the house to the west of the <span class="loc"><a href="#section 1_2_5">Hall of the Dead</a></span>). In actuality, it&rsquo;s a tunnel out of the city.  From there, he goes to Volunruud, north-east of the city. His passive perception is 12. If he detects the party, he will go running off towards Volunruud. If he dies, he is carrying the following note:
				</p>
				<quote>
					Here are the planned patrols around Volunruud. These should still be reliable, but my contact is starting to get anxious. I believe he may report our conversations to the Jarl. I recommend we send some soldiers out to take care of one of his patrols. <br/><br/>&mdash; Ornhar &mdash; <br/><br/> [What follows is a list of times, dates, positions, and contact schedules for various guard patrols around Whiterun]
