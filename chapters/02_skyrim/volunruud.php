				<h2>Quest Overview</h2>
				<h5>XP: 3/4</h5>
				<p>
					After following <span class="npc">Ornhar Wall-Shaker</span> out of the city to <span class="loc">Volunruud</span>, the party must infiltrate this Dragon Cult lair and search for clues as to the location of <span class="npc">Neradrys Telvanni</span>, the Dunmer mage suspected of causing the blizzard to the north.
					</p><p>
					At the end of the dungeon, the party finds Neradrys bound and gagged. When freed, he explains to the party that he was being held captive by the leader of the Dragon Cult to research an artifact the leader found. He implores the party to escort him to the jarl immediately, as he believes a dangerous attack against Skyrim is about to be launched.
					</p><p>
					The ruins are divided into two sections, separated by a thich iron door which can only be opened by placing two ceremonial weapons into inlets built into the door. The first section of the ruins contains the two weapons plus a Dragon Cult officer who details the door&rsquo;s mechanics. 
				</p>

				<h2><a id="finding_volunruud_anc"></a>Finding Volunruud</h2>
				<p>
					As detailed in the <span class="quest">Welcome to Skyrim</span> in the <a href="#finding_neradrys_anc">Tracking Down Neradrys</a> section, the party will discover the location of a Dragon Cult base in the Nordic ruins of Labyrinthian by investigating the suspicious activities of <span class="npc">Ornhar Wall-Shaker</span>. Alternatively, should Ornhar die in the course of that quest, a note on his body or evidence in his house will reveal that the Dragon Cult are gathering in the ruins.
					</p><p>
					The ruins are located to the north-west of the city. Most people in the city know the location of the ruins, and will be able to point the party to them. The exterior of the ruins is just a circular hole in the ground made out of nordic-engraved stone. Stairs lead from the surface down to the bottom of the hole, where the entrance to the ruins is. 
				</p>

				<h2><a id="inside_volunruud_anc" class="anchor"></a>Inside Volunruud</h2>

					<footnote>Map of Volunruud</footnote>
				</imagebox>
				<p>
					Volunruud is a burial site for ancient Nords. It is relatively small, compared to most Nordic ruins, but since its function was purely for housing the dead, it is understandably so. Recently the Dragon Cult has taken residence in the halls. Encounters in Volunruud will be composed of <span class="enemy">Dragon Cultists</span> and <span class="enemy">Draugr</span>. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="main_hall_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 1: Main Hall</h3>
				<p>
					This is the main hall of the ruins. In the center of the room are two columns which support the ceiling. At the southern end of the room there is the entrance to the ruins. At the northern end of the room there is a stairway leading to area 9. 
					</p><p>
					As the party enters the ruins from the southern entrance, if they followed Ornhar into the ruins, they will see him walk to the left, towards area 2.
				</p>
				<ul class="untabbed">
					<li>The encounter at the south end of the room is a <span class="enc">medium encounter</span></li>
					<li>The encounter in the middle of the room is an <span class="enc">easy encounter</span></li>
					<li>The encounter at the north end of the room is an <span class="enc">easy encounter</span></li>
					<li>The urn on the eastern side of the room contains <span class="loot">small loot</span></li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a id="side_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 2: Side Room</h3>
				<p>
					This is a small room off to the side of the main entrance. If the party followed Ornhar into the ruins, they will find him inside. As they approach, if they have a passive perception of 10 or higher they will hear talking on the other side of the room. With a DC 14 WIS (Perception) check, a member of the party can listen to the conversation on the other side of the door. On a success, they will hear Ornhar discussing patrol movements through the area. He will make a recommendation that they move Neradrys, as he believes the Jarl is searching for him.
					</p><p>
					In addition to Ornhar, who is a <span class="enemy">Dragon Cult Infiltrator</span>, this room holds a <span class="enc">hard encounter</span> with a minor boss, the official Ornhar is talking to. The official is carrying the following note on his body: 
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					Don&rsquo;t forget to check up on Grabjorn and Frilda. They have the weapons that keep the door to the inner crypt locked. If they lose or damage those weapons, I'll be trapped in the tomb with the obnoxious elf.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="west_hallway_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 3: West Hallway</h3>
				<p>
					This is a simple hallway connecting areas 1 and 4. The encounter at the south-east corner of the area is a <span class="enc">easy encounter</span> while the encounter to the north is a <span class="enc">medium encounter</span>.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="western_ceremonial_tomb_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 4: Western Ceremonial Tomb</h3>
				<p>
					This room is structured ceremonially, suggesting some ritual or religious significance to the chamber. The floor in the center of the room is slightly lower than the floor to the south and north. This floor is trapped, and whenever moving on this floor, a character must make a DC 12 DEX (Acrobatics) check to avoid the pressure plates. On a failed save, the move is still successful, but the character takes 1d4 piercing damage. These plates are clear to anyone with a passive perception of 10 or higher.
					</p><p>
					On the north end of the room are three standing stone coffins (one on either side and one in the center) holding high-level Draugr. A high-level Dragon Cultists stands in front of the middle coffin, facing it. The chest at the north end of the room contains <span class="loot">medium loot</span>, including a dull ceremonial axe.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="platform_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 5: Platform Room</h3>
				<p>
					This room has three levels: a bottom floor, two balconies on the east and west, and a bridge higher than the balconies going across the room. The encounter in this room is a <span class="enc">medium encounter</span>, including two Dragon Cultist archers on the eastern balcony. The chest to the north of the room contains <span class="loot">medium loot</span>. 
					</p><p>
					The red square to the east of the room indicates a trapped passageway leading into area 6. A passive perception of 16 or a DC 10 INT (Investigation) check will reveal the pressure plate at the base of the passageway. If the trap is triggered, the character must make a DC 14 DEX saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage from the swinging spike wall trap. The trap will reset. If the character sees the pressure plate, he or she can make a DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check to step over the plate. On a failed save, the trap is triggered, but the character has advantage on the saving throw. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="eastern_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 6: Eastern Room</h3>
				<p>
					This room contains a <span class="enc">easy encounter</span> and an urn which contains <span class="loot">small loot</span>. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="stairwell_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 7: Stairwell</h3>
				<p>
					This area contains stairs leading to the bridge in area 5, guarded by a <span class="enc">easy encounter</span>.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="eastern_ceremonial_tomb_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 8: Eastern Ceremonial Tomb</h3>
				<p>
					This room is structured ceremonially, suggesting some ritual or religious significance to the chamber. The eastern side of the room contains three standing stone coffins (one on either side and one in the middle). Each holds a high-level Draugr. In front of the middle coffin stands a high-level Dragon Cultist. The room collectively holds a <span class="enc">hard encounter</span> The chest at the east end of the room contains <span class="loot">medium loot</span>, including a dull ceremonial sword.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="door_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 9: Door Room</h3>
				<p>
					On the north end of this room is a large iron door, intricately decorated. The door has two insets: one for a sword and one for an axe. When the party places the ceremonial sword and axe found in the two ceremonial tombs, the door&rsquo;s locking mechanism will release and the door will open.
					</p><p>
					In front of the door is a stone coffin holding a high-level Draugr. Additionally, there are other enemies which form a <span class="enc">medium encounter</span>. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="northern_hallway_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 10: Northern Hallway</h3>
				<p>
					This hallway contains an <span class="enc">easy encounter</span>.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="main_crypt_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 11: Main crypt</h3>
				<p>
					This room is a large crypt with many Draugr corpses resting on inlets carved into the stone walls. At the eastern end the floor is slightly raised, and agains the wall there is a Draugr sitting on the throne. In front of the Draugr, casting a ritual over him, is a high-level Dragon Cultist. Surrounding them are various other enemies required to form a <span class="enc">hard encounter</span>.
					</p><p>
					The high-level Draugr wields an axe (<span class="item">Okin</span>) and a sword (<span class="item">Eduj</span>) each of leveled material with a leveled cold damage enchantment and 14 uses. 
				</p>

				<h3><a id="dragon_word_wall_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 12: Dragon Word Wall</h3>
				<p>
					This room contains one of the legendary Word Walls of the ancient Nords. If a party member knows the dragon language, he or she can translate the wall into this:
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					On this sacred ground did Fredo sacrifice her life so that her many children (could) escape and some day vanquish her enemy.
				</p>

				<h3><a id="neradryss_room_anc" class="anchor"></a>Area 13: Neradrys&rsquo;s Room</h3>
				<p>
					To the north-west of this area (west of the bridge) you will find Neradrys tied up and gagged. The encounter to the east is a <span class="enc">medium encounter</span> and the one to the west is an <span class="enc">easy encounter</span>. The chest to the west contains <span class="loot">large loot</span>. 
				</p>

				<h2><a id="rescuing_neradrys_anc" class="anchor"></a>Rescuing Neradrys</h2>
				<p>
					After the party unties and un-gags Neradrys, he will perfusely thank the party for saving him from the cultists. He will explain that he was kidnapped while he was doing research in his cabin, and the cultists tortured him and his research assistants until they helped him with a relic their leader, a man named <span class="npc">Kinvas</span>, had discovered in Labyrinthian. Apparently he used it to create the blizzard and wanted Neradrys&rsquo;s help harnessing its full power. 
					</p><p>
					Rescuing Neradrys will complete the quest, but the party must return to the Jarl to move on to the next quest.
