				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>
					Leyawiind functions as the primary port city of the Nibenay region of Tamriel. Far removed from the resources of the Imperial City, the city of Leyawiin has not be able to maintain security against the onslaught of pirates, smugglers, and thieves from Elsweyr and Black Marsh. The city is essentially run by three crime syndicates: the <span class="loc"><a href="#thieves_dist_anc">Thieves&rsquo; Guild</a></span>, the <span class="loc"><a href="#renrija_dist_anc">Renrija</a></span>, and the <span class="loc"><a href="#blackfin_dist_anc">Black Fins</a></span>. While the guards maintain order in the wealthy <span class="loc"><a href="#guilded_dist_anc">Guilded District</a></span>, they have only nominal control over the remaining city: the criminal organizations are responsible for maintaining order.
				</p><p>
					The city of Leyawiin is spread across the Niben River delta, where it meets the Topal Bay. They civilian districts are located on the east and west shores of the Niben River, with the city castle and the main fortifications of the <span class="loc"><a href="#castle_dist_anc">Castle District</a></span> of the city located on the middle island. Bridges connect the three parts of the city and regulate maritime commerce. A lighthouse sits upon the north end of the middle island, which towers over the castle and signals ships from both the Topal Bay and the Niben River.

				<h3><a id="guilded_dist_anc" class="anchor"></a>District 1: Guilded District</h3>
				<p>
					The Guilded District is the only area of Leyawiin not under the thumb of a criminal organization. The city guard make the district a priority because it houses all the wealthy and affluent citizens. These citizens court <span class="npc"><a>Aventorious Lementor</a></span>, the count of Leyawiin, and are given special privileges.
				</p><p>
					The Guilded District is located on the western shore of the Niben River. Two bridges connect the district to the Castle District. The northern bridge connects to the main avenue between the western and eastern shores. The southern bridge connects directly to the Castle District, and serves to allow the affluent quick access to the parties and events hosted by the count.
				</p><p>
					Artisans and merchants do not set up shop in the Guilded District. Instead, the wealthy either send servants to fetch supplies from across the river or call the artisans to them.
